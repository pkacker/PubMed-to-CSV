38733347,"Alzheimer's disease: insights into pathology, molecular mechanisms, and therapy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This condition casts a significant shadow on global health due to its complex and multifactorial nature. In addition to genetic predispositions, the development of AD is influenced by a myriad of risk factors, including aging, systemic inflammation, chronic health conditions, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. Recent advancements in understanding the complex pathophysiology of AD are paving the way for enhanced diagnostic techniques, improved risk assessment, and potentially effective prevention strategies. These discoveries are crucial in the quest to unravel the complexities of AD, offering a beacon of hope for improved management and treatment options for the millions affected by this debilitating disease.",Protein & cell
39612989,An overview of the genes and biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaque. Familial AD is caused by mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes and these mutations result in the early onset of the disease. Sporadic AD usually affects older adults over the age of 65 years and is, therefore classified as late-onset AD (LOAD). Several risk factors associated with LOAD including the APOE gene have been identified. Moreover, GWAS studies have identified a wide array of genes and polymorphisms that are associated with LOAD risk. Currently, the diagnosis of AD involves the evaluation of memory and personality changes, cognitive impairment, and medical and family history to rule out other diseases. Laboratory tests to assess the biomarkers in the body fluids as well as MRI, CT, and PET scans to analyze the presence of plaques and NFTs are also included in the diagnosis of AD. It is important to diagnose AD before the onset of clinical symptoms, i.e. during the preclinical stage, to delay the progression and for better management of the disease. Research has been conducted to identify biomarkers of AD in the CSF, serum, saliva, and urine during the preclinical stage. Current research has identified several biomarkers and potential biomarkers in the body fluids that enhance diagnostic accuracy. Aside from genetics, other factors such as diet, physical activity, and lifestyle factors may influence the risk of developing AD. Clinical trials are underway to find potential biomarkers, diagnostic measures, and treatments for AD mainly in the preclinical stage. This review provides an overview of the genes and biomarkers of AD.",Ageing research reviews
39918707,Clinical biomarkers of perioperative neurocognitive disorder: initiation and recommendation.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a significant neurological complication in aging perioperative patients that impacts post-operative cognition. PND is currently diagnosed through cognitive function testing, which is limited by its subjectivity and time requirements. Thus, the identification of biomarkers to assess PND onset is a priority to identify at-risk individuals and enable interventions and treatments to patient outcomes. This article synthesizes expert perspectives on brain aging and PND, presents the latest clinical evidence on PND biomarkers (imaging, electroencephalography, and molecular biomarkers), and delves into the relationship between PND and other age-related cognitive disorders. Thorough review of PND research identified several biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity, offering a solid scientific foundation to predict and diagnose PND. These biomarkers not only enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinicians but also provide opportunities for earlier intervention and more effective treatment, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.",Science China.

38915214,Brain injury biomarkers and applications in neurological diseases.,"Neurological diseases are a major health concern, and brain injury is a typical pathological process in various neurological disorders. Different biomarkers in the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid are associated with specific physiological and pathological processes. They are vital in identifying, diagnosing, and treating brain injuries. In this review, we described biomarkers for neuronal cell body injury (neuron-specific enolase, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, αII-spectrin), axonal injury (neurofilament proteins, tau), astrocyte injury (S100β, glial fibrillary acidic protein), demyelination (myelin basic protein), autoantibodies, and other emerging biomarkers (extracellular vesicles, microRNAs). We aimed to summarize the applications of these biomarkers and their related interests and limits in the diagnosis and prognosis for neurological diseases, including traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and infection. In addition, a reasonable outlook for brain injury biomarkers as ideal detection tools for neurological diseases is presented.",Chinese medical journal
39930142,Phospho-tau serine-262 and serine-356 as biomarkers of pre-tangle soluble tau assemblies in Alzheimer's disease.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with little or no quantifiable insoluble brain tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology demonstrate stronger clinical benefits of therapies than those with advanced NFTs. The formation of NFTs can be prevented by targeting the intermediate soluble tau assemblies (STAs). However, biochemical understanding and biomarkers of STAs are lacking. We show that Tris-buffered saline-soluble tau aggregates from autopsy-verified AD brain tissues include the core sequence ~tau(258-368). In neuropathological assessments, antibodies against the phosphorylation sites serine-262 and serine-356 within the STA core almost exclusively stained granular (that is, prefibrillar) tau aggregates in pre-NFTs while antibodies against phosphorylation at serine-202 and threonine-205 and threonine-231, outside the STA core, stained the entire spectrum of tau aggregates in pre-NFTs and mature NFTs, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads in the hippocampus. Functionally, a recombinantly produced STA core peptide robustly altered neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal brain slices. Furthermore, we developed a cerebrospinal fluid assay that differentiated STAs in AD from non-AD tauopathies, correlated with the severity of NFT burden and cognitive decline independently of amyloid beta deposition, and with tau positron emission tomography uptake across Braak NFT stages. Together, our findings inform about the status of early-stage tau aggregation, reveal aggregation-relevant phosphorylation epitopes in tau and offer a diagnostic biomarker and targeted therapeutic opportunities for AD.",Nature medicine
39988408,Brain white matter damage biomarkers.,"White matter (WM), constituting nearly half of the human brain's mass, is pivotal for the rapid transmission of neural signals across different brain regions, significantly influencing cognitive processes like learning, memory, and problem-solving. The integrity of WM is essential for brain function, and its damage, which can occur due to conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and traumatic brain injury, results in severe neurological deficits and cognitive decline. The primary objective of this book chapter is to discuss the clinical significance of fluid biomarkers in assessing WM damage within the central nervous system (CNS). It explores the biological underpinnings and pathological changes in WM due to various neurological conditions and details how alterations can be detected and quantified through fluid biomarkers. By examining biomarkers like Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), Neurofilament light chain (NFL), and others, the chapter highlights their role in enhancing diagnostic precision, monitoring disease progression, and guiding therapeutic interventions, thus providing crucial insights into maintaining WM integrity and preventing cognitive and physical disabilities.",Advances in clinical chemistry
39535517,Blood biomarkers in Down syndrome: Facilitating Alzheimer's disease detection and monitoring.,"Blood-based biomarkers continue to be explored for disease detection, monitoring of progression, and therapeutic outcomes as the diagnostic determination of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome (DS-AD) remains challenging in clinical settings. This perspective highlights the current status of this effort. Overall, amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) blood-based biomarkers have been shown to increase with disease pathology for individuals with DS. Phosphorylated tau biomarkers (p-tau217, p-tau181) have been consistently shown to track disease progression for DS-AD and are likely good candidates for use in clinical settings. Biomarkers of inflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein) also show promise; however, additional work is needed. Findings from stability work of blood-based biomarkers conducted among non-DS also support the potential longitudinal utility of biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain and p-tau181 in DS. Gaps in our knowledge are highlighted, and a potential role for sex differences in biomarker outcomes is noted, along with recommendations for determining the appropriate context of use when translating biomarkers into clinical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: An overview of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided for consideration of their utility among individuals with Down syndrome when looking toward potential clinical applications. Longitudinal stability of many blood biomarkers and improvement in detection sensitivity make blood such as plasma a viable source for exploring AD pathology. Variability in reviewed findings regarding the application of blood biomarkers highlights the importance of understanding and defining the appropriate context of use, particularly when translating them into clinical practice.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39807681,Clinical criteria for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy.,"Limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is highly prevalent in late life and a common co-pathology with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). LATE-NC is a slowly progressive, amnestic clinical syndrome. Alternatively, when present with ADNC, LATE-NC is associated with a more rapid course. With the emergence of anti-amyloid therapeutics, discrimination of LATE-NC from ADNC is critical and will lead to greater clinical recognition of amnestic patients without ADNC. Furthermore, co-pathology with LATE-NC may influence outcomes of these therapeutics. Thus there is a need to identify patients during life with likely LATE-NC. We propose criteria for clinical diagnosis of LATE as an initial framework for further validation. In the context of progressive memory loss and substantial hippocampal atrophy, criteria are laid out for probable (amyloid negative) or possible LATE (amyloid biomarkers are unavailable or when amyloid is present, but hippocampal neurodegeneration is out of proportion to expected pure ADNC). HIGHLIGHTS: Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a highly prevalent driver of neuropathologic memory loss in late life. LATE neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is a common co-pathology with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and may influence outcomes with emerging disease-modifying medicines. We provide initial clinical criteria for diagnosing LATE during life either when LATE-NC is the likely primary driver of symptoms or when observed in conjunction with AD. Definitions of possible and probable LATE are provided.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39232196,Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and their current use in clinical research and practice.,"While blood-based tests are readily available for various conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and common cancers, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases lack an early blood-based screening test that can be used in primary care. Major efforts have been made towards the investigation of approaches that may lead to minimally invasive, cost-effective, and reliable tests capable of measuring brain pathological status. Here, we review past and current technologies developed to investigate biomarkers of AD, including novel blood-based approaches and the more established cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers of disease. The utility of blood as a source of AD-related biomarkers in both clinical practice and interventional trials is discussed, supported by a comprehensive list of clinical trials for AD drugs and interventions that list biomarkers as primary or secondary endpoints. We highlight that identifying individuals in early preclinical AD using blood-based biomarkers will improve clinical trials and the optimization of therapeutic treatments as they become available. Lastly, we discuss challenges that remain in the field and address new approaches being developed, such as the examination of cargo packaged within extracellular vesicles of neuronal origin isolated from peripheral blood.",Molecular psychiatry
39998475,A head-to-head comparison of plasma biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease in a memory clinic.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been widely studied, but direct comparisons of several biomarkers in clinical settings remain limited. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma biomarkers from 197 participants in the BIODEGMAR cohort (Hospital del Mar, Barcelona) were analyzed. Participants were classified based on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers. We assessed the ability of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, t-tau, and Aβ42/40 to classify Aβ pathology status. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers had a greater diagnostic performance and larger effect sizes compared to t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Aβ pathology. Among them, plasma p-tau217 consistently outperformed the others, demonstrating superior area under the curves. Furthermore, p-tau217 showed the strongest correlation between plasma and CSF levels, underscoring its potential as a reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers. DISCUSSION: Several plasma biomarkers, targeting different epitopes and using different platforms, demonstrated high performance in detecting AD in a memory clinic setting. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers demonstrated higher diagnostic performance and larger effect sizes than t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Alzheimer's disease. Among the p-tau biomarkers, p-tau217 assays consistently outperformed the others, providing superior classification of Aβ pathology status across different phosphorylation sites. p-tau217 assays showed the strongest correlation between plasma and CSF levels, indicating its potential as a reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers. Several plasma p-tau biomarkers can be used in a specialized memory clinic to accurately detect Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39450480,Neuronal plasma biomarkers in acute ischemic stroke.,"Early imaging-based detection of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has improved in the era of reperfusion therapy. Despite of this, prognosis of outcome after AIS remains a challenge. Therefore, parameters that support clinical decision making are sought. Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to provide valuable information in addition to the established prognostic factors. Neuronal biomarkers of acute or degenerative neuronal injury have shown to be reliably detected in plasma. These biomarkers are well-established in neurodegenerative pathology, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we explored the association between stroke diameter and plasma biomarkers for neuronal injury and tau pathophysiology (brain-derived tau [BD-tau], phosphorylated-tau-217 [p-tau21] and neurofilament light [NfL]) in patients (n = 193) admitted to the acute ward, Akershus University Hospital. All patients received a final diagnosis of AIS, transient ischemic attack or stroke mimics. Blood samples were obtained the day after admission. We find that levels of BD-tau (p = .004) and NfL (p = .011) were higher after AIS than in patients with stroke mimics. The cortical stroke diameter correlated with BD-tau (tau-b = 0.64, p < .001) and p-tau217 (tau-b = 0.36, p = .003). Linear regression confirmed BD-tau to be the strongest variable associated with stroke diameter, pointing to the potential clinical value of plasma BD-tau in outcome prediction after AIS.",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the
39701184,Biomarkers of synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"Synapse has been considered a critical neuronal structure in the procession of Alzheimer's disease (AD), attacked by two pathological molecule aggregates (amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau) in the brain, disturbing synaptic homeostasis before disease manifestation and subsequently causing synaptic degeneration. Recently, evidence has emerged indicating that soluble oligomeric amyloid-β (AβO) and tau exert direct toxicity on synapses, causing synaptic damage. Synaptic degeneration is closely linked to cognitive decline in AD, even in the asymptomatic stages of AD. Therefore, the identification of novel, specific, and sensitive biomarkers involved in synaptic degeneration holds significant promise for early diagnosis of AD, reducing synaptic degeneration and loss, and controlling the progression of AD. Currently, a range of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), synaptotagmin-1, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), and neurogranin (Ng), along with functional brain imaging techniques, can detect variations in synaptic density, offering high sensitivity and specificity for AD diagnosis. However, these methods face challenges, including invasiveness, high cost, and limited accessibility. In contrast, biomarkers found in blood or urine provide a minimally invasive, cost-effective, and more accessible alternative to traditional diagnostic methods. Notably, neuron-derived exosomes in blood, which contain synaptic proteins, show variations in concentration that can serve as indicators of synaptic injury, providing an additional, less invasive approach to AD diagnosis and monitoring.",Ageing research reviews
39989429,Novel plasma biomarkers of amyloid plaque pathology and cortical thickness: Evaluation of the NULISA targeted proteomic platform in an ethnically diverse cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Proteomic evaluation of plasma samples could accelerate the identification of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We evaluated the novel NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) proteomic method in an ethnically diverse cohort. METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were measured with NULISA in the Human Connectome Project, a predominantly preclinical biracial community cohort in southwestern Pennsylvania. Selected biomarkers were additionally measured using Simoa and Quest immunoassays and compared. RESULTS: On NULISA, phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau231, and p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT-tau) showed the top significant association with amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) status, followed by the neuroinflammation markers C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), chitotriosidase 1 (CHIT1) and interleukin-8 (CXCL8), and the synaptic marker neurogranin (NRGN). Biomarkers associated with cortical thickness included astrocytic protein chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), cytokine CD40 ligand (CD40LG), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the Aβ-associated metalloprotein TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotein 3), and ficolin 2 (FCN2). Furthermore, moderate to strong between-platform correlations were observed for various assays. DISCUSSION: NULISA multiplexing advantage allowed concurrent assessment of established and novel plasma biomarkers of Aβ pathology and neurodegeneration. HIGHLIGHTS: Classical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers measured using the NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) with next-generation sequencing readout (NULISAseq) CNS panel showed strong concordance with those measured using established immunoassay methods from Quanterix and Quest, with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) exhibiting the strongest correlation. NULISAseq proteomic analysis identified several plasma biomarkers strongly associated with AD pathology in a biracial community cohort of older adults. Notably, phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217), GFAP, and p-tau231 displayed the strongest association with amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was strongly associated with neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that plasma biomarker levels could be influenced by age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and self-identified race. Specifically, GFAP, NfL, and surfactant protein D (SFTPD) showed a strong association with age; CD63 and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) with self-identified race; synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) with APOE genotype; and serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) with significant sex differences.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
38915268,Late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy: insights from brain atrophy and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Considering the growing age of the world population, the incidence of epilepsy in older adults is expected to increase significantly. It has been suggested that late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy (LO-TLE) may be neurodegenerative in origin and overlap with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we aimed to characterize the pattern of cortical atrophy and CSF biomarkers of AD (total and phosphorylated tau and amyloid-β) in a selected population of LO-TLE of unknown origin. We prospectively enrolled individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy onset after the age of 50 and no cognitive impairment. They underwent a structural MRI scan and CSF biomarkers measurement. Imaging and biomarkers data were compared to three retrospectively collected groups: (i) age-sex-matched healthy controls; (ii) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (MCI-AD); and (iii) patients with MCI and normal CSF AD biomarkers (MCI-noAD). From a pool of 52 patients, 20 consecutive eligible LO-TLE patients with a mean disease duration of 1.8 years were recruited. As control populations, 25 patients with MCI-AD, 25 patients with MCI-noAD and 25 healthy controls were enrolled. CSF biomarkers returned normal values in LO-TLE, significantly different from patients with MCI due to AD. There were no differences in cortico-subcortical atrophy between epilepsy patients and healthy controls, while patients with MCI demonstrated widespread injuries of cortico-subcortical structures. Individuals with LO-TLE, characterized by short disease duration and normal CSF amyloid-β and tau protein levels, showed patterns of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes not significantly different from healthy controls, but highly different from patients with MCI, either due to AD or not.",Brain : a journal of neurology
39559926,"Homocysteine, neurodegenerative biomarkers, and APOE ε4 in neurodegenerative diseases.","INTRODUCTION: Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is associated with an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases; however, its relationship with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has not been well characterized. METHODS: Participants clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, or cerebrovascular disease were stratified by the presence of the APOE ε4 allele. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, plasma amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration biomarkers, and cognitive performance were quantified. RESULTS: Across all diagnostic groups, Hcy was associated with lower brain parenchymal fraction and greater neurofilament light chain in APOE ε4 non-carriers only. In AD/MCI, Hcy was associated with phosphorylated tau 217 in APOE ε4 non-carriers, but not in carriers. Exploratory analyses revealed interactions between Hcy and APOE ε4 on memory and visuospatial function. DISCUSSION: Hcy may contribute to neurodegeneration depending on the presence of the APOE ε4 allele and specific disease processes. Trials on vitamin B12 supplementation may consider stratifying by APOE genotype. Highlights Homocysteine (Hcy) was associated with neurodegenerative biomarkers across disease groups. Relationships with Hcy were predominantly found in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 non-carriers. In Alzheimer's disease, associations between Hcy and phosphorylated tau 217 were found in APOE ε4 non-carriers only. Significant interactions existed between Hcy and APOE ε4 status on cognition.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39427525,Novel plasma protein biomarkers: A time-dependent predictive model for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for the efficient management of its progression. The objective of this research was to construct a new risk predictive model utilizing novel plasma protein biomarkers for predicting AD incidence in the future and analyze their potential biological correlation with AD incidence. METHODS: A cohort of 440 participants aged 60 years and older from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) longitudinal cohort was utilized. The baseline plasma proteomics data was employed to conduct Cox regression, LASSO regression, and cross-validation to identify plasma protein signatures predictive of AD risk. Subsequently, a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model based on these signatures was constructed. The performance of the risk prediction model was evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (t-ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, we analyzed the correlations between protein signature expression in plasma and predicted AD risk, the time of AD onset, the expression of protein signatures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the expression of CSF and plasma biomarkers, and APOE ε4 genotypes. Colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses was conducted to investigate the association between protein features and AD risk. GEO database was utilized to analyze the differential expression of protein features in the blood and brain of AD patients. RESULTS: We identified seven protein signatures (APOE, CGA, CRP, CCL26, CCL20, NRCAM, and PYY) that independently predicted AD incidence in the future. The risk prediction model demonstrated area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.77, 0.76, and 0.77 for predicting AD incidence at 4, 6, and 8 years, respectively. Furthermore, the model remained stable in the range of the 3rd to the 12th year (ROC ≥ 0.74). The low-risk group, as defined by the model, exhibited a significantly later AD onset compared to the high-risk group (P < 0.0001). Moreover, all protein signatures exhibited significant correlations with AD risk (P < 0.001) and the time of AD onset (P < 0.01). There was no strong correlation between the protein expression levels in plasma and CSF, as well as AD CSF biomarkers. APOE, CGA, and CRP exhibited significantly lower expression levels in APOE ε4 positive individuals (P < 0.05). Additionally, colocalization analysis reveals a significant association between AD and SNP loci in APOE. Mendelian randomization analysis shows a negative correlation between NRCAM and AD risk. Transcriptomic analysis indicates a significant downregulation of NRCAM and PYY in the peripheral blood of AD patients (P < 0.01), while APOE, CGA, and NRCAM are significantly downregulated in the brains of AD patients (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our research has successfully identified protein signatures in plasma as potential risk biomarkers that can independently predict AD onset in the future. Notably, this risk prediction model has demonstrated commendable predictive performance and stability over time. These findings underscore the promising utility of plasma protein signatures in dynamically predicting the risk of AD, thereby facilitating early screening and intervention strategies.",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics
39535341,The case for regulatory approval of amyloid-lowering immunotherapies in Alzheimer's disease based on clearcut biomarker evidence.,"Decades of research have provided evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused in part by cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Aβ). In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration gave full regulatory approval to a disease-modifying Aβ antibody for early AD. Secondary prevention trials with Aβ antibodies are underway. We summarize peer-reviewed evidence for targeting Aβ and argue that regulators should consider approving new agents working by similar mechanisms (Aβ antibodies and vaccines) based on robust amyloid lowering and reasonable safety. The urgent need to provide treatments to millions of mildly symptomatic patients suggests that AD should join other diseases for which standard approval is based on significant changes in mechanistically meaningful biomarkers coupled with safety. Robust amyloid lowering in secondary prevention trials of people who have amyloid plaques but are asymptomatic could also provide evidence of a change in the pathophysiological progression of AD as a basis for regulatory approval. HIGHLIGHTS: Thirteen key findings support amyloid beta as a cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three immunotherapies lower amyloid and slow decline, allowing regulatory approval. New such agents could be considered for approval due to amyloid lowering and safety. Urgency suggests AD may join diseases with approval due to a key biomarker + safety.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39776249,Updated appropriate use criteria for amyloid and tau PET: A report from the Alzheimer's Association and Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Workgroup.,"INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to update appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. METHODS: The workgroup identified key research questions that guided a systematic literature review on clinical amyloid/tau PET. Building on this review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each scenario by consensus as ""rarely appropriate,"" ""uncertain,"" or ""appropriate."" Ratings were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone modalities. RESULTS: For amyloid PET, seven scenarios were rated as appropriate, two as uncertain, and eight as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, five scenarios were rated as appropriate, six as uncertain, and six as rarely appropriate. DISCUSSION: AUC for amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for clinical use of these technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. HIGHLIGHTS: A multidisciplinary workgroup convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging updated the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. The goal of these updated AUC is to assist clinicians in identifying clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be useful for guiding the diagnosis and management of patients who have, or are at risk for, cognitive decline These updated AUC are intended for dementia specialists who spend a significant proportion of their clinical effort caring for patients with cognitive complaints, as well as serve as a general reference for a broader audience interested in implementation of amyloid and tau PET in clinical practice.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39907163,Multifaceted Biomarkers Suggest a Similar Profile of CNS Pathology in Relapsing and Progressive MS.,"BACKGROUND: Relapsing-remitting (RR) and primary progressive (PP) multiple sclerosis (MS) have distinct clinical courses, but underlying pathophysiological differences remain unclear. We compared pathological components between RRMS, PPMS, and other inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, leveraging soluble biomarkers and post-mortem pathology. METHODS: Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of people diagnosed with (pw) PPMS (n = 104), RRMS (n = 38), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 22), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD, n = 10), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-associated disease (MOGAD, n = 10) were collected. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), soluble CD27 (sCD27), osteopontin (OPN), chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP25) were measured. Lymphocytes (CD20(+), CD138(+), CD3(+)) and pyramidal-tract axonal density in RR-onset (n = 86) and PPMS (n = 45) post-mortem brain tissue were quantified. RESULTS: Soluble and post-mortem tissue biomarkers did not differ between pwRRMS and pwPPMS. Compared to AD, MS had higher CSF sCD27 (p < 0.001) but lower serum CHI3L1 and GFAP, and CSF OPN and SNAP25 (all p < 0.05). Serum OPN was lower in RRMS than NMOSD (p = 0.013). Principal component analyses and K-means clustering showed substantial overlap of RRMS and PPMS biomarkers, distinct from AD. In all pwMS, serum NfL and CSF BCMA correlated with clinical/radiological disease activity, CSF BCMA and sCD27 with inflammatory parameters, and serum GFAP, CSF GFAP, and CSF NfL with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. CONCLUSIONS: Serum and CSF soluble biomarker profiles and post-mortem pathology do not differentiate RRMS from PPMS diagnoses but reflect the extent of inflammation and tissue damage. Detailed assessment of MS-associated inflammation and tissue damage may enhance classification and therapeutic strategies.",European journal of neurology
39572740,Tau filaments are tethered within brain extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease.,"The abnormal assembly of tau protein in neurons is a pathological hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Assembled tau associates with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the central nervous system of individuals with AD, which is linked to its clearance and prion-like propagation. However, the identities of the assembled tau species and EVs, as well as how they associate, are not known. Here, we combined quantitative mass spectrometry, cryo-electron tomography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to study brain EVs from individuals with AD. We found tau filaments composed mainly of truncated tau that were enclosed within EVs enriched in endo-lysosomal proteins. We observed multiple filament interactions, including with molecules that tethered filaments to the EV limiting membrane, suggesting selective packaging. Our findings will guide studies into the molecular mechanisms of EV-mediated secretion of assembled tau and inform the targeting of EV-associated tau as potential therapeutic and biomarker strategies for AD.",Nature neuroscience
39575672,APOE ε4-associated heterogeneity of neuroimaging biomarkers across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"INTRODUCTION: While the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility has been studied extensively, much less is known about the differences in disease presentation in APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers. METHODS: To help elucidate these differences, we performed a broad analysis comparing the regional levels of six different neuroimaging biomarkers in the brains of APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers who participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). RESULTS: We observed significant APOE ε4-associated heterogeneity in regional amyloid beta deposition, tau accumulation, glucose uptake, brain volume, cerebral blood flow, and white matter hyperintensities within each AD diagnostic group. We also observed important APOE ε4-associated differences in cognitively unimpaired individuals who converted to mild cognitive impairment/AD versus those who did not convert. DISCUSSION: This observed heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers between APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers may have important implications regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD in different subpopulations. HIGHLIGHTS: An extensive study was performed on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4-associated heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Robust APOE ε4-associated increases in amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition throughout the brain, in every diagnostic group, were observed. APOE ε4-associated increases in tau pathology, decreases in glucose uptake, and increases in brain atrophy, which expand in regional scope and magnitude with disease progression, were observed. Significant sex- and age-related differences in APOE ε4-associated neuroimaging biomarker heterogeneity, with overall increases in pathological presentation in female APOE ε4 carriers, were observed.

To ensure a forthcoming application of this low-invasive diagnostic that might allow to recognize early onset of dementia, appropriate pathological cut-points need to be defined. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we measured blood and CSF neurofilament light chain (NFL), phosphorylated tau (pTau 181), Amyloid-β1-42 (AB 1-42) and Amyloid-β1-40 (AB 1-40) on a fully automated chemiluminescent platform (Lumipulse, Fujirebio) in 80 cognitively impaired patients and 55 cognitively unimpaired subjects. Clinical cut points were calculated with receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a head-to-head comparison of blood and CSF testing was performed. RESULTS: Blood NFL best discriminant thresholds to distinguish neurodegenerative diseases from controls varied age-dependently, being 19 and 33 pg/mL in subjects 50-65 years and > 65 years respectively. AD was best framed by AB 1-42/1-40 ratio < 0.079 and ptau181 > 1 pg/mL. Though a strong correlation for all biomarkers, only blood AB ratio was equal to CSF testing for AD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The specific context of use might be considered to define the cut-offs of blood biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Future efforts towards reference materials for each AD blood biomarker will improve clinical cut-offs.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry
39814656,Cutting through the noise: A narrative review of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers for routine clinical use.,"As novel, anti-amyloid therapies have become more widely available, access to timely and accurate diagnosis has become integral to ensuring optimal treatment of patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma biomarkers are a promising tool for identifying AD pathology; however, several technical and clinical factors need to be considered prior to their implementation in routine clinical use. Given the rapid pace of advancements in the field and the wide array of available biomarkers and tests, this review aims to summarize these considerations, evaluate available platforms, and discuss the steps needed to bring plasma biomarker testing to the clinic. We focus on plasma phosphorylated(p)-tau, specifically plasma p-tau217, as a robust candidate across both primary and secondary care settings. Despite the high performance and robustness demonstrated in research, plasma p-tau217, like all plasma biomarkers, can be affected by analytical and pre-analytical variability as well as patient comorbidities, sex, ethnicity, and race. This review also discusses the advantages of the two-point cut-off approach to mitigating these factors, and the challenges raised by the resulting intermediate range measurements, where clinical guidance is still unclear. Further validation of plasma p-tau217 in heterogeneous, real-world cohorts will help to increase confidence in testing and support establishing a standardized approach. Plasma biomarkers are poised to become a more affordable and less invasive alternative to PET and CSF testing. However, understanding the factors that impact plasma biomarker measurement and interpretation is critical prior to their implementation in routine clinical use.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39940998,Plasma Biomarkers in the Distinction of Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia.,"Plasma biomarkers are promising tools for the screening and diagnosis of dementia in clinical settings. We analyzed plasma levels of Alzheimer's core biomarkers, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), through single-molecule Array in 108 patients with Alzheimer's (AD, cerebrospinal fluid with an amyloid+ tau+ neurodegeneration+ profile), 73 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD, 24 with genetic diagnosis), and 54 controls. The best area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminative power. Patients with AD had lower Aß42/40 ratios and NfL levels, along with higher levels of p-tau181 and GFAP, compared with FTD patients. Single biomarkers discriminated well between dementia patients and controls: the Aß42/40 ratio (AUC:0.86) or GFAP (AUC:0.83) was found for AD, and the NfL (AUC:0.84) was found for FTD patients. However, a combination of two (NfL with p-tau181, or the GFAP/NfL ratio, AUCs ~0.87) or three biomarkers (NfL, P-tau181, and Aß42/40 ratio, AUC: 0.90) was required to distinguish between AD and FTD. Biomarker profiles were similar across different FTD phenotypes, except for carriers of PGRN mutations, who had higher levels of NfL than C9orf72 expansion carriers. In our series, NfL alone provided the best distinction between FTD and controls, while a combination of two or three biomarkers was required to obtain good discrimination between AD and FTD.",International journal of molecular sciences
39449333,The Role of circRNAs in the Pathological Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease: Potential Biomarkers for Diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia in the elderly, and the mechanisms of AD have not been fully defined. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed RNAs produced by reverse splicing, have critical effects in the pathogenesis of AD. CircRNAs participate in production and clearance of Aβ and tau, regulate neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity and the process of apoptosis and autophagy, indicating that circRNAs may be alternative biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our review summarizes the functions of circRNAs in the progression and development of AD, which provide insights into the prospect of circRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Current neuropharmacology
39842814,Serum proteomics reveals early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease: The dual role of APOE-ε4.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, significantly impacts global public health, with cases expected to exceed 150 million by 2050. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), predominantly influenced by the APOE-ε4 allele, exhibits complex pathogenesis involving amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Proteomics has emerged as a pivotal technology in uncovering molecular mechanisms and identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention in AD. This paper reviews the genetic and molecular roles of APOE-ε4 in the pathology of AD, including its effects on Aβ aggregation, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and BBB integrity. Additionally, it highlights recent advances in serum proteomics, revealing APOE-ε4-dependent and independent protein signatures with potential as early biomarkers for AD. Despite technological progress, challenges such as population diversity, standardization, and distinguishing AD-specific biomarkers remain. Directions for future research emphasize multicenter longitudinal studies, multi-omics integration, and the clinical translation of proteomic findings to enable early detection of AD and personalized treatment strategies. Proteomics advances in AD research hold the promise of improving patient outcomes and reducing the global disease burden.",Bioscience trends
39641397,Clinical value of novel blood-based tau biomarkers in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnostic and prognostic performance of the novel fluid biomarkers brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is not defined. METHODS: We measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma BD-tau, p-tau217, p-tau181, total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), and 14-3-3 in 100 CJD patients, 100 with non-prion rapidly progressive dementia (np-RPD), 92 with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI), and 55 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Plasma BD-tau performed comparably to plasma t-tau but had lower performance than CSF t-tau (p < 0.001) and 14-3-3 (p = 0.014) in CJD versus np-RPD differential diagnosis. Plasma BD-tau diagnostic accuracy increased when ratioed to plasma p-tau217, matching CSF 14-3-3. Plasma BD-tau levels were associated with survival (p < 0.001), outperforming t-tau and NfL. DISCUSSION: Plasma BD-tau is a valuable marker for CJD prognostication. In the clinical setting, the plasma BD-tau/p-tau217 ratio provides an accurate, fast marker supporting the clinical diagnosis of CJD. HIGHLIGHTS: The increase of plasma BD-tau levels parallels that of CSF t-tau in CJD. CSF p-tau217 levels are significantly increased in CJD, reflecting a prion-specific secondary tauopathy. Plasma p-tau217 shows a distinct profile than CSF p-tau217 in CJD. Plasma BD-tau/p-tau217 ratio is as accurate as CSF 14-3-3 in distinguishing CJD from np-RPDs, including AD.

39128995,Melatonin: A potential nighttime guardian against Alzheimer's.,"In the context of the escalating global health challenge posed by Alzheimer's disease (AD), this comprehensive review considers the potential of melatonin in both preventive and therapeutic capacities. As a naturally occurring hormone and robust antioxidant, accumulating evidence suggests melatonin is a compelling candidate to consider in the context of AD-related pathologies. The review considers several mechanisms, including potential effects on amyloid-beta and pathologic tau burden, antioxidant defense, immune modulation, and regulation of circadian rhythms. Despite its promise, several gaps need to be addressed prior to clinical translation. These include conducting additional randomized clinical trials in patients with or at risk for AD dementia, determining optimal dosage and timing, and further determining potential side effects, particularly of long-term use. This review consolidates existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and suggests directions for future research to better understand the potential of melatonin for neuroprotection and disease mitigation within the landscape of AD.",Molecular psychiatry

40045806,Treatment of iNPH: novel insights.,"This review advocates for a shift from traditional symptom-based diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) to a deeper investigation into its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly the role of altered cerebral hydrodynamics as an important pathological hallmark. We explore the heterogeneity of iNPH, emphasizing its frequent overlap and cooccurrence with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and subcortical vascular encephalopathy, complicating diagnosis and treatment strategies. The lumbar infusion test emerges as a useful diagnostic tool, offering quantitative insights into CSF outflow resistance that should be considered as a useful biomarker related to cerebral hydrodynamics and iNPH pathophysiology. Furthermore, we propose the hypothesis that shunt placement, by regulating brain fluid mechanics, may also serve as a form of neuromodulation, potentially enhancing neuronal function and mitigating clinical symptoms. This review advocates for an interdisciplinary, physics-based and patient-centered approach that emphasizes early detection, accurate diagnostics, and personalized treatment plans to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life, particularly in the aging population.",Journal of neurosurgical sciences
40018325,Association between BrainAGE and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"INTRODUCTION: The brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) method uses a machine learning model to generate an age estimate from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal was to study the association of brain age with Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging and plasma biomarkers. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three individuals from the Indiana Memory and Aging Study underwent structural MRI, amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma sampling. The MRI scans were processed using the software program BrainAgeR to receive a ""brain age"" estimate. Plasma biomarker concentrations were measured, and partial Pearson correlation models were used to evaluate their relationship with brain age gap (BAG) estimation (BrainAGE = chronological age - MRI estimated brain age). RESULTS: Significant associations between BAG and amyloid and tau levels on PET and in plasma were observed depending on diagnostic categories. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that BAG is potentially a biomarker of pathology in AD which can be applied to routine brain imaging. HIGHLIGHTS: Novel research that uses an artificial intelligence learning tool to estimate brain age.Findings suggest that brain age gap is associated with plasma and positron emission tomography Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.Differential relationships are seen in different stages of disease (preclinical vs. clinical).Results could play a role in early AD diagnosis and treatment.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40044393,"Post-cardiovascular disease healthy lifestyle, inflammation and metabolic biomarkers, and risk of dementia: a population-based longitudinal study.","BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with an increased risk of dementia, but the impact of healthy lifestyle on post-CVD dementia remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the association between post-CVD healthy lifestyle factors and risk of dementia. We further examined whether inflammation and metabolic biomarkers played a role in this association. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 77,324 dementia-free participants with prevalent CVD from the UK Biobank. We constructed the lifestyle score based on no current smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, healthy diet, adequate sleep duration, less sedentary behavior, and frequent social contact. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to examine the association of healthy lifestyle with risk of CVD-related dementia. Mediation models were fitted to investigate the underlying mechanisms driven by systemic inflammation, lipid profiles, liver/renal function, and blood pressure indices. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.43 y, 1605 all-cause dementia (ACD) cases were documented, including 646 Alzheimer's dementia (AD) cases and 427 vascular dementia (VaD) cases. Healthy lifestyle scores were significantly associated with lower risk of dementia. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the participants with 6-7 healthy lifestyle score were 0.50 (0.40, 0.62) for ACD, 0.80 (0.58, 1.10) for AD, and 0.30 (0.19, 0.48) for VaD, compared their counterpart with 0-1 score. Low-grade inflammatory markers and specific metabolic biomarkers were detected to significantly mediated the observed associations, explaining 1%∼11% of the associations of healthy lifestyle factors with dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors is significantly associated with a lower risk of dementia in individuals with CVD. The observed associations may be partly explained by a reduction in systemic inflammation and the promotion of metabolic balance.",The American journal of clinical nutrition
39780249,"evoke and evoke+: design of two large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies evaluating efficacy, safety, and tolerability of semaglutide in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying therapies targeting the diverse pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including neuroinflammation, represent potentially important and novel approaches. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity and has an established safety profile. Semaglutide may have a disease-modifying, neuroprotective effect in AD through multimodal mechanisms including neuroinflammatory, vascular, and other AD-related processes. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in early-stage symptomatic AD. METHODS: evoke and evoke+ are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic AD. Eligible participants were men or women aged 55-85 years with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD with confirmed amyloid abnormalities (assessed by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] analysis). After a maximum 12-week screening phase, an anticipated 1840 patients in each trial are randomized (1:1) to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension). Randomized participants follow an 8-week dose escalation regimen (3 mg [weeks 0-4], 7 mg [weeks 4-8], and 14 mg [weeks 8-156]). The primary endpoint is the semaglutide-placebo difference on change from baseline to week 104 in the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes score. Analyses of plasma biomarkers, collected from all participants, and a CSF sub-study (planned n = 210) will explore semaglutide effects on AD biomarkers and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Enrollment was undertaken between May 18, 2021, and September 8, 2023. Completion of the trials' main phase is expected in September 2025, and the 52-week extension (in which participants and investigators remain blinded to treatment assignment) will continue to October 2026. CONCLUSION: evoke and evoke+ are the first large-scale trials to investigate the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in participants with early-stage symptomatic AD, including exploration of effects on AD biomarkers and neuroinflammation. The trials will provide data on the potential disease-modifying effects of semaglutide and will be important in evaluating its utility in the treatment of early-stage symptomatic AD.

40190307,Identification of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and their immune function characterization.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with neurogenic fiber tangles caused by amyloid-β protein plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation as the pathological manifestations. This study was based on multi-omics to investigate the mechanisms and immune characterization of AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on bulk RNA-seq (GSE122063 and GSE97760), we screened potential biomarkers for AD by differential expression analysis and machine learning algorithms. Then, we analyzed the expression characteristics and immune functions of the above biomarkers by scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA sequencing) data analysis (GSM4996463 and GSM4996462) and immune infiltration analysis. RESULTS: Five biomarkers (RBM3, GOLGA8A, ALS2, FSD2, and LOC100287628) were identified using machine learning algorithms. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of these biomarkers in astrocytes from AD samples compared to normal samples. Additionally, three key biomarkers were selected based on interaction networks, and the diagnostic models indicated high diagnostic efficacy for these biomarkers. Based on immune infiltration and correlation analyses, RBM3, GOLGA8A, and ALS2 were all highly correlated with CD8 T cell content in the immune microenvironment of AD. CONCLUSIONS: The biomarkers identified in this study demonstrate significant diagnostic potential for AD. Notably, the downregulation of RBM3 in astrocytes and the decreased presence of CD8 T cells infiltrating brain tissue are potential risk factors for AD.",Archives of medical science : AMS
40002697,Non-Invasive Retinal Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain associated with ageing and is the most prevalent form of dementia, affecting an estimated 55 million people worldwide, with projections suggesting this number will exceed 150 million by 2050. With its increasing prevalence, AD represents a significant global health challenge with potentially serious social and economic consequences. Diagnosing AD is particularly challenging as it requires timely recognition. Currently, there is no effective therapy for AD; however, certain medications may help slow its progression. Existing diagnostic methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and biomarker analysis in cerebrospinal fluid tend to be expensive and invasive, making them impractical for widespread use. Consequently, research into non-invasive biomarkers that enable early detection and screening for AD is a crucial area of contemporary clinical investigation. One promising approach for the early diagnosis of AD may be retinal imaging. As an extension of the central nervous system, the retina offers a distinctive opportunity for non-invasive brain structure and function assessment. Considering their shared embryological origins and the vascular and immunological similarities between the eye and brain, alterations in the retina may indicate pathological changes in the brain, including those specifically related to AD. Studies suggest that structural and vascular changes in the retina, particularly within the neuronal network and blood vessels, may act as markers of cerebral changes caused by AD. These retinal alterations have the potential to act as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Since AD is typically diagnosed only after a significant neuronal loss has occurred, identifying early diagnostic markers could enable timely intervention and help prevent disease progression. Non-invasive retinal imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, provide accessible methods for the early detection of changes linked to AD. This review article focuses on the potential of retinal imaging as a non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. Investigating the ageing of the retina and its connections to neurodegenerative processes could significantly enhance the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of AD, paving the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",Biomedicines
39713874,Identification of circulating risk biomarkers for cognitive decline in a large community-based population in Chongqing China.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to investigate the relationship between blood-based pathologies and established risk factors for cognitive decline in the community-based population of Chongqing, a region with significant aging. METHODS: A total of 26,554 residents aged 50 years and older were recruited. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to assess the risk factors of cognition levels. Propensity score matching and linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate the relationship between key risk factors and the circulating biomarkers. RESULTS: Shared and distinct risk factors for MCI and dementia were identified. Age, lower education, medical history of stroke, hypertension, and epilepsy influenced mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression to dementia. Correlations between key risk factors and circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid β protein (Aβ)40, and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio suggest underlying mechanisms contributing to cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: The common and distinct risk factors across cognitive decline stages emphasize the need for tailored interventions. The correlations with blood biomarkers provide insights into potential management targets. HIGHLIGHTS: From a large community-based cohort study on the residents in Chongqing, we have identified that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia share several common risk factors, including age, female gender, rural living, lower education levels, and a medical history of stroke. However, each condition also has its own unique risk factors. Several factors contribute to the progression of MCI into dementia including age, education levels, occupation, and a medical history of hypertension and epilepsy. We discover the correlations between the risk factors for dementia and blood biomarkers that indicate the presence of axonal damage, glial activation, and Aβ pathology.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

METHODS: We enrolled 128 adults (64 with Alzheimer's disease, 41 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 23 with normal cognition [NC]), mean age 70.8 ± 9.6 years, 56.9% female, from a tertiary hospital in China. Participants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG), amyloid β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma biomarker analysis: phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). RESULTS: After adjusting for demographics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status, cognition, and comorbidities, the highest tertile of REM latency was associated with higher Aβ burden (β = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03 to 0.13, p = 0.002), elevated p-tau181 (β = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.13, p = 0.002), and reduced BDNF levels (β = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.13, p = 0.013), compared to the lowest tertile. DISCUSSION: Prolonged REM latency may serve as a novel marker or risk factor for AD/ADRD pathogenesis. HIGHLIGHTS: Rapid eye movement latency (REML) may be a potential marker for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) pathogenesis. Prolonged REML was associated with higher amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181), and lower brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.

39453382,Neuronal cathepsin S increases neuroinflammation and causes cognitive decline via CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis and JAK2-STAT3 pathway in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Aging is an intricate process involving interactions among multiple factors, which is one of the main risks for chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a member of cysteine protease, cathepsin S (CTSS) has been implicated in inflammation across various diseases. Here, we investigated the role of neuronal CTSS in aging and AD started by examining CTSS expression in hippocampus neurons of aging mice and identified a significant increase, which was negatively correlated with recognition abilities. Concurrently, we observed an elevation of CTSS concentration in the serum of elderly people. Transcriptome and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) results revealed that CTSS overexpression in neurons aggravated brain inflammatory milieu with microglia activation to M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, activation of chemokine C-X3-C-motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1)-chemokine C-X3-C-motif receptor 1 (CX3CR1) axis and janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. As CX3CL1 is secreted by neurons and acts on the CX3CR1 in microglia, our results revealed for the first time the role of neuron CTSS in neuron-microglia ""crosstalk."" Besides, we observed elevated CTSS expression in multiple brain regions of AD patients, including the hippocampus. Utilizing CTSS selective inhibitor, LY3000328, rescued AD-related pathological features in APP/PS1 mice. We further noticed that neuronal CTSS overexpression increased cathepsin B (CTSB) activity, but decreased cathepsin L (CTSL) activity in microglia. Overall, we provide evidence that CTSS can be used as an aging biomarker and plays regulatory roles through modulating neuroinflammation and recognition in aging and AD process.",Aging cell
39868381,Retinal biomarkers for the risk of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.,"PURPOSE: Differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be challenging due to overlapping cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Evidence regarding non-invasive and early-stage biomarkers remains limited. Our aim was to identify retinal biomarkers for the risk of AD and FTD in populations without dementia and explore underlying brain structural mechanisms. METHODS: We included a total of 3,0573 UK Biobank participants without dementia, ocular disorders, and diabetes who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between macular OCT parameters and the risk of AD and FTD. Mediation analysis was used to explore the underlying mechanisms affected by brain structures. RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment was 55.27, and 46.10% of the participants were male. During a mean follow-up of 9.15 ± 2.59 years, 148 patients with AD and eight patients with FTD were identified. Reduced thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) at baseline was associated with an increased risk of AD (HR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.001-1.066; P = 0.044), while thinner retinal pigment epithelial in the inner superior subfield at baseline was associated with an elevated risk of FTD (HR, 1.409; 95% CI, 1.060-1.871; P = 0.018). Structurally abnormal visual pathways, including cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes, as well as white matter integrity, mediated the association between the GC-IPL thickness and AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide preliminary empirical support for a relationship between prodromal changes in retinal layers and a higher risk of AD or FTD, suggesting that macular OCT may serve as a non-invasive, sensitive biomarker of high-risk years before the onset of dementia.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39800452,Blarcamesine for the treatment of Early Alzheimer's Disease: Results from the ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 Phase IIB/III trial.,"BACKGROUND: There are no approved oral disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of blarcamesine (ANAVEX®2-73), an orally available small-molecule activator of the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in early AD through restoration of cellular homeostasis including autophagy enhancement. DESIGN: ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week Phase IIb/III trial. SETTING: Multicenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries. INTERVENTION: 508 participants with early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to receive either blarcamesine (n = 338) in medium dose group 30 mg or in high dose group 50 mg or placebo (n = 170) oral capsules once daily for 48 weeks. Participants in these groups were offered to enroll into the open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, which completed June 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04314934. MEASUREMENTS: The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as change in ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR-SB and biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All clinical endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), plasma biomarker measurements were analyzed by Welch's t-test, and volumetric MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model. RESULTS: Among 462 randomized participants in the intent-to-treat population (mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), 338 (73.2%) completed the trial. The co-primary outcome was met under the multiplicity control rule, since the differences in the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to 48 weeks between the prespecified blarcamesine and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog13 was significant at a level of P < 0.025 and for CDR-SB was significant at a level of P < 0.025, while ADCS-ADL did not reach significance at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -2.027 [95% CI -3.522 to -0.533]; P = 0.008; CDR-SB difference of -0.483 [95% CI -0.853 to -0.114]; P = 0.010; ADCS-ADL difference of 0.775 [95%CI -0.874 to 2.423]; P = 0.357). Plasma Aβ42/40-ratio increased significantly with blarcamesine group vs. placebo, (P = 0.048) and whole brain volume loss was significantly decreased (P = 0.002). Participants in the full safety population with ≥1 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 56 participants (16.7%) in the blarcamesine and 17 (10.1%) in the placebo group. Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. One death in the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group were both not considered treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: Blarcamesine, demonstrating a safety profile with no associated neuroimaging adverse events, significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks with blarcamesine group as well as the individual 30 mg (by 34.6%) and 50 mg (by 38.5%) blarcamesine groups vs. placebo on the prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. The prespecified secondary endpoint CDR-SB, which is used as the sole primary endpoint in recent successful AD drug submissions, is significantly improved at Week 48 with blarcamesine relative to placebo. The findings are supported by biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, including plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and reduction of whole brain atrophy. Additionally, the prespecified SIGMAR1 gene variant subgroup analysis confirmed beneficial clinical effect of blarcamesine group through upstream SIGMAR1 activation - subjects with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant) experienced an even greater significant clinical benefit with slowed clinical progression by 49.8% at 48 weeks on the prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13.

39968707,Unlocking ocular biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that ocular testing holds promise as a non-invasive and cost-effective method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). After interviews with neurologists, optometrists, primary care physicians, and ophthalmologists, the potential for ocular biomarker testing to become a standard clinical practice in the future was assessed. Ocular tests offer a non-invasive alternative to blood-based testing, capturing a substantial niche of ≈ 4 to 8 million individuals in the United States during routine eye exams. Technical requirements for broad adoption include high accuracy comparable to blood-based tests and 510(k) clearance. Ocular biomarker technology must meet the practical requirements of optometrists and ophthalmologists, including ease of implementation, automation, and a clear path to profitability. A sufficient body of evidence to support guideline inclusion, reimbursement, and clinical actionability will facilitate the adoption. As the field evolves, advances such as earlier detection of preclinical AD may further expand the role of ocular testing. HIGHLIGHTS: Ocular biomarkers offer another non-invasive alternative to blood-based Alzheimer's disease testing. Wide adoption will require accuracy akin to blood-based tests and 510(k) clearance. Ocular screening could benefit ≈ 4 to 8 million US individuals conducting routine eye exams. Current ocular offerings remain nascent, and advances could expand this reach. New technology must show ease of implementation, automation, and a path to profit.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
38772708,The Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) involves both the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS), and their interaction is important for understanding both the clinical manifestations of the disease and the underlying disease pathophysiology. Although the neuroanatomical distribution of pathology strongly suggests that the ENS is involved in disease pathophysiology, there are significant gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms. In this article, we review the clinical presentation and management of gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD. In addition, we discuss the current understanding of disease pathophysiology in the gut, including controversies about early involvement of the gut in disease pathogenesis. We also review current knowledge about gut α-synuclein and the microbiome, discuss experimental models of PD-linked gastrointestinal pathophysiology, and highlight areas for further research. Finally, we discuss opportunities to use the gut-brain axis for the development of biomarkers and disease-modifying treatments.",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine
39907189,Differential roles of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in stepwise biomarker-guided diagnostics.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the differential roles of various plasma biomarkers in a stepwise diagnostic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A total of 2984 participants, including 666 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 2032 with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS), and 286 non-ACS individuals, were recruited. Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, four phosphorylated tau (p-tau) epitopes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured using immunoassays. RESULTS: NfL demonstrated fair to excellent accuracy in differentiating non-ACS from CU groups (area under the curve [AUC], 0.79 to 0.94). p-tau217 had the highest accuracy for identifying Aβ (AUC 0.94) and tau positron emission tomography status (AUC 0.91). In the ACS group, p-tau217 was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline (p < .001). DISCUSSION: NfL may serve as a useful screening tool, while p-tau217 is particularly valuable for confirming AD pathology and prognosis. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma NfL could screen for cognitive impairment. p-tau217 reliably detects AD pathology, regardless of diagnosis. p-tau217 and GFAP predict prognosis in ACS. Each plasma biomarker plays a distinct role in stepwise AD diagnostics.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39761671,Lecanemab-Associated Amyloid-β Protofibril in Cerebrospinal Fluid Correlates with Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The Clarity AD phase III trial showed that lecanemab reduced amyloid markers in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and resulted in less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo. Herein, we aimed to characterize amyloid-β (Aβ) protofibril (PF) captured by lecanemab in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living participants with different stages in AD, which enable an enhanced understanding of the dynamic changes of lecanemab-associated Aβ-PF (Lec-PF) in vivo. METHODS: We newly developed a unique and highly sensitive immunoassay method using lecanemab that selectively captures Lec-PF. The CSF level of Lec-PF, Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau 217, total tau, and neurogranin were measured in Japanese participants (n = 163). The participants in this study consisted of 48 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-negative (CU-), 8 cognitively impaired diagnosed as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, 9 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-positive (CU+), 34 Aβ-positive with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 64 Aβ-positive with AD dementia (AD+). RESULTS: The CSF Lec-PF levels significantly increased in the groups of MCI+ and AD+ compared with CU- group. Notably, CSF Lec-PF showed modest correlation with plaque-associated biomarkers in Aβ-positive participants and stronger correlation with neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as CSF total tau and neurogranin, suggesting that CSF Lec-PF levels proximally reflect neurodegeneration as well as the amount of senile amyloid plaques. INTERPRETATION: This is the first report describing Aβ-PF species captured by lecanemab in human CSF and supporting that Lec-PF is correlated with neurodegeneration in AD and may explain the mechanism of the clinical effect of lecanemab.

40092057,Redefining disease in the age of blood-based biomarkers.,"This article explores the sociological and ethical implications of redefining disease in the era of advanced diagnostic technologies, with a focus on blood-based biomarkers. Drawing from Foucault's concept of medicalization and Illich's critique of disease mongering, it highlights how diagnostic expansions, driven by corporate and institutional influences, are reshaping the boundaries of health and disease. Advances such as blood assays for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, liquid biopsies in oncology, and biomarkers for depression and diabetes, while promising, raise concerns about premature diagnoses and overtreatment. The influence of pharmaceutical and insurance industries on diagnostic criteria, as seen in the ICD updates, underscores the need to address conflicts of interest and regulatory gaps. Case studies on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's reveal how these changes could benefit stakeholders at the expense of patient welfare. The article calls for ethical oversight, stricter regulation, and research into the population-level efficacy of diagnostic and treatment protocols.",Frontiers in sociology
39887504,Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 are effective biomarkers for identifying CSF- and PET imaging-diagnosed Alzheimer's disease: Insights for research and clinical practice.,"INTRODUCTION: With the advancement of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), validating plasma biomarkers against cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) standards is crucial in both research and real-world settings. METHODS: We measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, amyloid beta (Aβ)1-40, Aβ1-42, and neurofilament light chain in research and real-world cohorts. Participants were categorized by brain amyloid status using US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved CSF or PET methods. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 demonstrated superior accuracy in detecting brain amyloid pathologies, with area under the curve from 0.94 to 0.97 in all cohorts. Specificity was lower in the real-world cohort but improved significantly by integrating demographic and clinical factors, aligning performance with research cohorts. Additionally, plasma biomarkers exhibited strong correlations with their CSF counterparts and PET standardized uptake value ratios, with significant associations in amyloid-positive participants. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 are effective diagnostic tools. However, patient demographics, apolipoprotein E ε4 status, and cognitive condition must be considered to improve specificity in the clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and p-tau217/amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42 demonstrated exceptional accuracy (area under the curve: 0.94-0.97) in detecting brain amyloid pathologies across both research (Southern China Aging Brain Initiative [SCABI]-1, SCABI-2) and real-world clinical practice (RCP) cohorts. Incorporating patient-specific factors (sex, age, apolipoprotein E ε4, cognitive status) improved diagnostic specificity in the clinical RCP cohort, aligning its performance with that of research cohorts. Plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau217 and their ratios, showed robust correlations with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography amyloid standardized uptake value ratios, underscoring their value as non-invasive diagnostic alternatives. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 proved highly effective in diagnosing amyloid burden, offering a practical solution to bridge research advancements with real-world clinical practice.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39973550,Research Progress on Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Based on the ATX(N) Framework.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Early diagnosis and treatment of AD are of paramount importance, with the concept of biomarkers being intrinsically linked to diagnosis and therapy. Biomarkers are indices that can be objectively measured to indicate normal biological processes, pathological conditions, or responses to therapeutic interventions. In 2023, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association released updated clinical diagnostic guidelines, refining the 2018 research framework. These guidelines categorize AD biomarkers into three types: core AD biomarkers, non-specific biomarkers of tissue response related to AD pathophysiology, and biomarkers for non-AD comorbidities, thus enhancing the amyloid/tau/x/neurodegeneration (ATX(N)) framework. This article aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements within the ATX(N) framework and the progress in the study of various biomarkers under this framework. It analyzes how biomarkers can facilitate early disease diagnosis, discusses the challenges of translating biomarkers into effective treatments, and explores their therapeutic prospects.",Discovery medicine..
38953237,The influence of time-restricted eating/feeding on Alzheimer's biomarkers and gut microbiota.,"OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 55 million individuals globally. Diagnosis typically occurs in advanced stages, and there are limited options for reversing symptoms. Preventive strategies are, therefore, crucial. Time Restricted Eating (TRE) or Time Restricted Feeding (TRF) is one such strategy. Here we review recent research on AD and TRE/TRF in addition to AD biomarkers and gut microbiota. METHODS: A comprehensive review of recent studies was conducted to assess the impact of TRE/TRF on AD-related outcomes. This includes the analysis of how TRE/TRF influences circadian rhythms, beta-amyloid 42 (Aß42), pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and gut microbiota composition. RESULTS: TRE/TRF impacts circadian rhythms and can influence cognitive performance as observed in AD. It lowers beta-amyloid 42 deposition in the brain, a key AD biomarker, and reduces pro-ininflammatory cytokines. The gut microbiome has emerged as a modifiable factor in AD treatment. TRE/TRF changes the structure and composition of the gut microbiota, leading to increased diversity and a decrease in harmful bacteria. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the potential of TRE/TRF as a preventive strategy for AD. By reducing Aß42 plaques, modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and altering gut microbiota composition, TRE/TRF may slow the progression of AD. Further research is needed to confirm these effects and to understand the mechanisms involved. This review highlights TRE/TRF as a promising non-pharmacological intervention in the fight against AD.",Nutritional neuroscience

39863333,Core blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease: A single-center real-world performance study.,"BACKGROUND: The new criteria for Alzheimer's disease pave the way for the introduction of core blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (BBAD) into clinical practice. However, this depends on the demonstration of sufficient accuracy and robustness of BBADs in the intended population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic performance of core BBADs in our memory clinic, comparing them with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. DESIGN: Real-world cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Memory Clinic of Fondazione IRCCS ""San Gerardo dei Tintori,"" Monza, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: n = 102 consecutive outpatients (mean age: 71.0 ± 7.6 years) with cognitive impairment undergoing routine lumbar puncture. MEASUREMENTS: CSF Aβ40, Aβ42, tTau, and pTau181 levels were measured. Plasma biomarkers were evaluated using Lumipulse® G600II. Logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to assess biomarker performance. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was based on CSF Aβ42/40 ratio. RESULTS: Plasma pTau217 demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.91), followed by pTau181 (AUC=0.88) and Aβ42/40 (AUC=0.83). In robustness analyses, only pTau217 and pTau181 performance remained consistent, while that of Aβ42/40 ratio declined with added random variability. pTau217 significantly outperformed other BBAD, with the exception of pTau181. pTau BBAD were significant predictors of baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma pTau217, measured with Lumipulse®, is a robust and reliable BBAD for detecting amyloid pathology in a memory clinic setting, offering a practical and less invasive alternative to traditional CSF testing.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39575871,Benchmarking of a multi-biomarker low-volume panel for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"INTRODUCTION: In the research setting, obtaining accurate established biomarker measurements and maximizing use of the precious samples is key. Accurate technologies are available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but no platform can measure all the established and emerging biomarkers in one run. The NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) is a technology that requires 15 µL of sample to measure more than 100 analytes. METHODS: We compared AD-relevant biomarkers included in the NULISA against validated assays in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. RESULTS: CSF measures of amyloid beta 42/40, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 are highly correlated when measured by immunoassay, mass spectrometry, or NULISA. In plasma, p-tau217 performance is similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis. Other biomarkers show a wide range of correlation values depending on the fluid and the platform. DISCUSSION: The NULISA multiplexed platform produces reliable results for established biomarkers in CSF that are useful in research settings, with the advantage of measuring additional biomarkers using minimal sample volume. HIGHLIGHTS: We tested the novel technology NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) in the dementia research setting.

39836940,"Association of Polygenic Risk Score for 5 Diseases With Alzheimer Disease Progression, Biomarkers, and Amyloid Deposition.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increase AD risk and progression. This study aimed to examine the genetic predisposition to these conditions and their effect on AD pathophysiology, risk, and progression. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a North American prospective cohort. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for OSA, T2D, coronary artery disease (CAD), major depression, and body mass index (BMI) were generated for 752 non-Hispanic White participants with whole-genome sequencing data. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between PRSs and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Time to progression across PRS quartiles was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. PET amyloid and tau deposition rates, regional neocortical atrophy, and cognitive composite score declines were compared across OSA PRS quartiles using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Among 463 ADNI participants with baseline MCI (mean age 72.6 ± 7.3 years, 43.4% female), the OSA PRS, adjusted for BMI, was significantly associated with MCI-to-AD progression. The highest OSA PRS quartile had an odds ratio of 1.86 (95% CI 1.03-3.37) at 3 years and 2.02 (95% CI 1.16-3.51) at 5 years, compared with the lowest quartile. PRSs for T2D, CAD, major depression, and BMI were not associated with MCI-to-AD progression. Participants in the highest OSA PRS quartile had higher PET amyloid deposition and greater cognitive decline. In 752 participants (mean age 74.1 ± 7.3 years, 43.6% female), OSA PRS was significantly associated with baseline levels of PET amyloid, CSF amyloid-β 42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), visinin-like protein 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and plasma neurofilament light after multiple testing adjustments. DISCUSSION: Individuals with high polygenic susceptibility to OSA exhibited an increased risk of MCI-to-AD progression and a higher amyloid deposition rate, suggesting potential modifier effects of OSA or OSA-associated genes on AD progression and pathophysiology. However, the small sample size and lack of objective OSA diagnosis limit interpretation of these genetic effects.",Neurology
40046335,Plasma biomarkers for diagnosis and differentiation and their cognitive correlations in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Increasing evidence has shown the potential value of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic and differential values of emerging plasma biomarkers for different types of dementia in a Chinese population and to explore their cognitive correlations. One hundred twenty patients with dementia, including 51 Alzheimer's disease patients, 54 subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia (SIVD) patients and 15 frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients were recruited alongside 27 cognitively unimpaired (CU) control subjects. Global and domain-specific cognition was assessed in all participants by a battery of neuropsychological tests. Plasma amyloid-beta (Αβ)42, Aβ40 and total tau (in CU controls and Alzheimer's disease patients) and phosphorylated tau at threonine-181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) levels (in all participants) were measured using the single-molecule array platform. The levels of all biomarkers differed between Alzheimer's disease patients and CU controls, with P-tau181 and GFAP levels and the Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio best differentiating the two groups [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.966, 0.932 and 0.927, respectively]. P-tau181 and GFAP levels were greater in the Alzheimer's disease group than in the other two patient groups and showed the best performance in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease patients from SIVD (AUC = 0.922) and FTLD patients (AUC = 0.894), respectively. Moreover, compared with that in the CU group, the GFAP level was elevated in the SIVD group, and the NfL level was elevated in all patient groups. Compared with other single biomarkers, the plasma Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio correlated with broader cognitive domains, including global cognition [Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), r = 0.314, P = 0.027; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), r = 0.313, P = 0.043], memory (r = 0.339, P = 0.016), language (r = 0.333, P = 0.020), attention and information processing speed (r = 0.369, P = 0.008), executive function (r = 0.305, P = 0.031) and visuospatial function memory (r = 0.453, P = 0.001). P-tau181 was an optimal plasma biomarker for identifying Alzheimer's disease patients and differentiating Alzheimer's disease patients from SIVD and FTLD patients. Moreover, the GFAP level and the Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio showed potential diagnostic and progression monitoring value, respectively, for Alzheimer's disease patients.",Brain communications

Saliva is an emerging specimen for measuring AD biomarkers, with distinct contexts of use that could complement blood and cerebrospinal fluid and detect various analytes. An interdisciplinary, international group of AD and related dementias (ADRD) researchers convened and performed a narrative review of published studies on salivary AD biomarkers. We critically appraised the current state of the literature, examining both consistencies and discrepancies in existing pre-analytical variables and methodologies. We discussed how various pre-analytical variables could influence the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers, showed technologies available to standardize collection procedures, and proposed a standardized pre-analytical protocol to guide future studies on salivary AD biomarker examinations. We identified potential contexts of use, gaps, and priorities and proposed future research directions. HIGHLIGHTS: Given its non-invasive nature, wider accessibility, and cultural acceptability, particularly in low-resourced settings, saliva is a biofluid complementary to blood and CSF. Current salivary AD biomarker studies do not control for many confounding pre-analytical variables during the sampling process, potentially leading to inaccurate salivary biomarker readings and conclusions, contributing to conflicting findings. Reviewing the current literature, including the consistencies and non-consistencies observed in the existing parameters and methodologies, discussing how they can affect salivary AD biomarker detection and quantification.

39535473,Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarker variability: Amyloid-independent and amyloid-dependent factors.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to investigate which factors affect plasma biomarker levels via amyloid beta (Aβ)-independent or Aβ-dependent effects and improve the predictive performance of these biomarkers for Aβ positivity on positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: A total of 2935 participants underwent blood sampling for measurements of plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217; ALZpath), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels using single-molecule array and Aβ PET. Laboratory findings were collected using a routine blood test battery. RESULTS: Aβ-independent factors included hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for p-tau217 and hemoglobin, eGFR, and triiodothyronine (T(3)) for GFAP and NfL. Aβ-dependent factors included apolipoprotein E genotypes, body mass index status for Aβ42/40, p-tau217, GFAP, and NfL. However, these factors exhibited negligible or modest effects on Aβ positivity on PET. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of accurately interpreting plasma biomarkers for predicting Aβ uptake in real-world settings. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated factor-Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarker associations in a large Korean cohort. Hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate affect the biomarkers independently of brain amyloid beta (Aβ). Apolipoprotein E genotypes and body mass index status affect the biomarkers dependent on brain Aβ. Addition of Aβ-independent factors shows negligible effect in predicting Aβ positivity. Adjusting for Aβ-dependent factors shows a modest effect in predicting Aβ positivity.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

METHODS: We included 262 dementia-free participants with baseline and follow-up interviews (2010-2021). At baseline, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) was assessed from diffusion tensor imaging. Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using a single-molecule immune-array assay. Cognitive function was evaluated using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and domain-specific cognitive tests. RESULTS: Participants with high-level PSMD, p-tau217, and NfL showed the fastest decline of MMSE (β = -0.30) and the highest dementia incidence of 3.54/100 person-years. A combination model with three markers demonstrated a good predictive value for dementia, incorporating age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E (area under the curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval = 0.86, 0.99). DISCUSSION: Combining co-pathology markers may identify individuals with a high risk of cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) was correlated with long-term cognitive decline, and this correlation was modified by plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Participants with high levels of PSMD, p-tau217, and NfL showed the fastest cognitive decline and the highest risk of dementia.

METHODS: Amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET), volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma biomarkers used to assess gantenerumab treatment related changes on neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation over 116 weeks. RESULTS: Gantenerumab reduced amyloid PET load, CSF biomarkers of amyloid beta (Aβ)40, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), neurogranin, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), neurofilament light (NfL), alpha-synuclein (α-syn), neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), and plasma biomarkers of t-tau, p-tau181, p-tau217, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) while increasing plasma Aβ40, Aβ42. vMRI showed increased reduction in whole brain volume and increased ventricular expansion, while hippocampal volume was unaffected. Tau PET showed no treatment effect. DISCUSSION: Robust treatment effects were observed for multiple biomarkers in GRADUATE I and II. Comparison across anti-amyloid antibodies indicates utility of p-tau and GFAP as biomarkers of amyloid plaque removal while NfL and tau PET seem unsuitable as consistent indicators of clinical efficacy. vMRI might be confounded by non-neurodegenerative brain volume changes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER): NCT03444870 and NCT03443973. HIGHLIGHTS: Gantenerumab significantly reduced brain amyloid load. Tau positron emission tomography showed no treatment effect in a small subset of participants.

METHODS: We included 215 participants from the PREVENT-AD cohort with plasma Aβ(42/40) and p-tau217, 159 with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ(42/40) and p-tau217, and 155 with (18)F-NAV4694 and (18)F-flortaucipir PET scans. MCI progression was determined by multidisciplinary consensus among memory experts blind to biomarker and genetic information. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazard models indicated a greater progression rate in A+T+(plasma) and A-T+(plasma) compared to A-T-(plasma) individuals (HR = 7.81 [95% CI = 3.92 to 15.59] and HR = 4.25 [1.60-11.31] respectively). Similar results were found with CSF (HR = 3.63 [1.72-7.70]) and PET (HR = 9.30 [3.67-23.55]). DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 is a prognostic marker for identifying individuals who will develop cognitive impairment within ten years. HIGHLIGHTS: Elevated plasma p-tau217 levels in CU individuals indicate future clinical progression. Adding plasma Aβ(42/40) status to p-tau markers did not improve the prediction to MCI. All individuals with abnormal tau PET measured in a temporal meta-ROI progressed to MCI.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39887317,Biofluid biomarkers in distinguishing young-onset dementia from primary psychiatric disorders.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been growing interest in the role of biofluid biomarkers to aid the diagnosis of dementia in older people. However, less attention has been given to younger people who have dementia (young-onset dementia), who frequently experience misdiagnoses of primary psychiatric disorders diagnostic delay and challenges accessing appropriate care. RECENT FINDINGS: We describe 12 studies from the previous 2 years of which the majority have investigated the role of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid in distinguishing young-onset dementia from primary psychiatric disorders. Synaptic and astrocytic biomarkers were also investigated. Sample sizes ranged from n = 46 to n = 999 and studies were mostly from Australia and the Netherlands. SUMMARY: The major finding from this review was that NfL has very high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating a range of young-onset dementias (Alzheimer's dementia, behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia) from PPD (schizophrenia, bipolar affective and major depressive disorders). NfL is easily accessible via the blood, so there is significant potential that a blood test could be available to make this dichotomisation.

This study examines how sex influences the longitudinal trajectories of plasma AD and neurodegenerative biomarkers in the years following a person's estimated onset of amyloid-β. METHODS: Linear mixed-effects modeling investigated overall and sex-specific longitudinal trajectories of plasma biomarkers, brain volumes, and cognition relative to the estimated age of amyloid onset in a cohort of 78 amyloid-positive Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) participants (n = 45 male; follow-up time: 6.8 years [SD 3.31]). Amyloid status was ascertained with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging. RESULTS: After amyloid onset, men displayed steeper increases in pTau181, pTau231, and neurofilament light (NfL) compared to women. In this same period, men demonstrated steeper declines in brain volume and cognitive performance. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that sex influences the trajectory of AD pathology, neuronal injury, and symptom progression after individuals become amyloid-positive. HIGHLIGHTS: Steeper rates of increase in pTau and GFAP among amyloid-positive individuals. After amyloid onset, steeper increases in pTau and NfL concentrations in men than in women. Steeper declines in brain volume and cognition in men corroborate biomarker results.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39885359,Plasma proteomic evidence for increased β-amyloid pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Previous studies have suggested that systemic viral infections may increase risks of dementia. Whether this holds true for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infections is unknown. Determining this is important for anticipating the potential future incidence of dementia. To begin to do this, we measured plasma biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology in the UK Biobank before and after serology-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with biomarkers associated with β-amyloid pathology: reduced plasma Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and, in more vulnerable participants, lower plasma Aβ42 and higher plasma pTau-181. The plasma biomarker changes were greater in participants who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 or had reported hypertension previously. We showed that the changes in biomarkers were linked to brain structural imaging patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease, lower cognitive test scores and poorer overall health evaluations. Our data from this post hoc case-control matched study thus provide observational biomarker evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with greater brain β-amyloid pathology in older adults. While these results do not establish causality, they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 (and possibly other systemic inflammatory diseases) may increase the risk of future Alzheimer's disease.",Nature medicine
39889254,Association of Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer Disease and Neurodegeneration With Longitudinal Intra-Network Functional Brain Connectivity.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) is defined by cortical β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration, which contribute to cognitive decline, in part, by altering large-scale functional brain networks. While cortical Aβ and tau have been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity, it is unknown whether plasma biomarkers relate to such changes. In a healthy community sample of cognitively unimpaired adults free from major CNS disease from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we examined whether plasma biomarkers of AD pathology (Aβ(42/40), phosphorylated tau [pTau-181]), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were associated with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity and whether changes in functional connectivity were related to longitudinal cognition. METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were measured using the Quanterix SIMOA assays. Intranetwork connectivity (3T resting-state fMRI) from 7 functional networks was derived using a predefined cortical parcellation mask for each participant visit. Cognitive performance was assessed concurrently with fMRI scan. Covariate-adjusted linear mixed-effect models were used to determine (1) whether plasma biomarkers were associated with longitudinal changes in connectivity, (2) whether the magnitude of the biomarker-connectivity relationships differed by amyloid status, and (3) whether changes in connectivity co-occurred with longitudinal changes in cognition. RESULTS: Our primary findings (n = 486; age = 65.5 ± 16.2 years; 54% female; mean follow-up time = 4.3 ± 1.7 years) showed that higher baseline GFAP was associated with faster declines in somatomotor (β = -0.04, p = 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01), limbic (β = -0.03, p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.005), and frontoparietal (β = -0.04, p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01) network connectivity. Amyloid status moderated several biomarker-connectivity associations. For instance, higher baseline NfL was related to faster declines in visual and limbic network connectivity, but only among amyloid-positive participants. Among 421 participants with ≥2 fMRI visits (age = 71.7 ± 11.4 years; 55% female; follow-up time = 3.9 ± 1.6 years), longitudinal changes in connectivity were associated with concurrent declines in cognition; however, these results did not survive multiple comparison correction. DISCUSSION: Among cognitively unimpaired participants, plasma biomarkers of amyloidosis, astrogliosis, and neuronal injury are associated with declines in network connectivity, particularly among amyloid-positive participants. Major limitations include the lack of inclusion of the sensitive pTau-217 and pTau-231 isoforms and comparative PET biomarkers.",Neurology
39997929,"Epigenetic Biomarkers Driven by Environmental Toxins Associated with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in the United States: A Systematic Review.","Environmental toxins and epigenetic changes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This paper aimed to (i) identify environmental toxins associated with AD, PD, and ALS, (ii) locate potential industrial sources of toxins in the United States (U.S.), and (iii) assess epigenetic changes driven by exposure to toxins reported by patients. Environmental factors and epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compiled from 69 studies in the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and geographic information system approaches. Some 127 environmental toxins have been associated or putatively associated with AD, PD, or ALS, with four toxic metals (As, Cd, Mn, and Hg) common to all three of these neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental toxins associated with epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) in patients include air pollutants, metals, and organic chemicals (e.g., pesticides, mycotoxins, and cyanotoxins). Geographic analysis showed that study locations (e.g., U.S., Europe, and East Asia) were selected by researchers based on convenience of access rather than exposure risk and disease prevalence. We conclude that several toxins and epigenetic markers shared among neurodegenerative diseases could serve as attractive future targets guiding environmental quality improvements and aiding in early disease detection.",Toxics
39701863,Disentangling relationships between Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers and established biomarkers in patients of tertiary memory clinics.,"BACKGROUND: Several plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have demonstrated diagnostic and analytical robustness. Yet, contradictory results have been obtained regarding their association with standard diagnostic markers of AD. This study aims to investigate the specific relationship between the AD biomarkers currently used in clinical practice and the plasma biomarkers. METHODS: In a memory clinic cohort, we analysed plasma pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, respectively, GFAP, NfL, CSF pTau181, Aβ-PET scans, and MRI/CT visual read of atrophy. We utilized methods based on multiple linear regression to evaluate the specific associations between clinically used and recently developed plasma biomarkers, while also considering demographic variables such as age and sex. FINDINGS: Although plasma pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and GFAP were significantly associated with both Aβ-PET and CSF pTau181, Aβ-PET explained more variance in the levels of these biomarkers. The effect of CSF pTau181 on plasma GFAP and pTau181 was completely attenuated by Aβ-PET, whereas pTau231 and pTau217 were affected by both Aβ-PET and CSF pTau181 levels. Unlike these biomarkers, increased NfL was rather indicative of brain atrophy and older age. Based on the effect sizes, plasma pTau217 emerged as highly effective in distinguishing between A+ and A-, and T+ and T- individuals, with 60% of variance in plasma pTau217 explained by clinical AD biomarkers. INTERPRETATION: Amyloid burden primarily drives the changes in plasma pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and GFAP. In contrast to plasma pTau217, a significant portion of variance in plasma pTau181, pTau231, GFAP, NfL remains unexplained by clinical AD biomarkers.

39834250,"SGLT2 inhibition, circulating biomarkers, and Alzheimer's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is a novel category of medications for diabetes, exhibiting neuroprotective potential. However, evidence regarding whether the use of SGLT2 inhibitors effectively reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate potential causal relationships between SGLT2 inhibition, metabolites, and AD. METHODS: In our research, we used a two-sample MR method to explore the link between SGLT2 inhibitor use and AD, addressing both its late-onset and early-onset forms. Furthermore, we executed a two-step MR analysis to explore how circulating metabolites, primarily endogenous in nature due to SGLT2 inhibition, mediate the relationship between SGLT2 inhibition and AD. The genetic instruments for SGLT2 inhibition were pinpointed through their association with SLC5A2 gene expression and the decreased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. RESULTS: Genetic analysis indicated that SGLT2 inhibition, which effectively reduces HbA1c by enhancing renal glucose excretion and improving glycemic control, was associated with a lower likelihood of developing AD for every 1 SD decrease in HbA1c (OR = 0.48, [0.36, 0.63], p < 0.001). Our MR analysis revealed that SGLT2 inhibition significantly affected 27 of the 123 metabolites examined, adhering to a Bonferroni correction threshold (p < 4.06 × 10-4). Among these 27 significant metabolites, citrate was also associated with AD, showing a significant association (0.81 [0.79, 0.83], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides strong evidence linking SGLT2 inhibition with a lower AD risk, highlighting citrate's potential mediating role for subsequent clinical research.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD

39985487,"Machine learning prediction of tau-PET in Alzheimer's disease using plasma, MRI, and clinical data.","INTRODUCTION: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a reliable neuroimaging technique for assessing regional load of tau pathology in the brain, but its routine clinical use is limited by cost and accessibility barriers. METHODS: We thoroughly investigated the ability of various machine learning models to predict clinically useful tau-PET composites (load and laterality index) from low-cost and non-invasive features, for example, clinical variables, plasma biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Models including plasma biomarkers yielded the most accurate predictions of tau-PET burden (best model: R-squared = 0.66-0.69), with especially high contribution from plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217). MRI variables were the best predictors of asymmetric tau load between the two hemispheres (best model: R-squared = 0.28-0.42). The models showed high generalizability to external test cohorts with data collected at multiple sites. Through a proof-of-concept two-step classification workflow, we also demonstrated possible model translations to a clinical setting. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the promising and limiting aspects of using machine learning to predict tau-PET from scalable cost-effective variables, with findings relevant for clinical settings and future research. HIGHLIGHTS: Accessible variables showed potential in estimating tau tangle load and distribution. Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were the best predictors of different tau-PET (positron emission tomography) composites. Machine learning models demonstrated high generalizability across AD cohorts.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39138758,miR-92a-3p and miR-320a are Upregulated in Plasma Neuron-Derived Extracellular Vesicles of Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia.,"Despite the efforts to identify fluid biomarkers to improve diagnosis of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), only a few candidates have been described in recent years. In a previous study, we identified three circulating miRNAs (miR-92a-3p, miR-320a and miR-320b) differentially expressed in FTD patients with respect to healthy controls and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Now, we investigated whether those changes could be due to miRNAs contained in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs). We also evaluated miRNAs content in total plasma EVs and in CSF samples. The analysis of plasma NDEVs carried out on 40 subjects including controls (n = 13), FTD (n = 13) and AD (n = 14) patients, showed that both miR-92a-3p and miR-320a levels were triplicated in the FTD group if compared with CT and AD patients. Increased levels of the same miRNAs were found also in CSF derived from FTD group compared to CTs. No differences were observed in expression levels of miR-320b among the three groups. Worthy of note, all miRNAs analysed were increased in an FTD cell model, MAPT IVS10 + 16 neurons. Our results suggest that miR-92a and miR-320a in NDEVs could be proposed as FTD biomarkers.",Molecular neurobiology
39435610,Three-dimensional view of microglia-amyloid plaque interactions.,"Recent gene expression studies have revealed about 10 different states of microglia, some of which are characteristic for Alzheimer-like amyloid plaque pathology. However, it is not presently known how these translate into morphological features that would reflect microglia interaction with amyloid plaques. With optimized conditions for confocal microscopy in amyloid plaque forming APP/PS1 transgenic mice we reveal new details of how microglia processes interact with amyloid plaques. The microglia contacts differed drastically between purely diffuse plaque and those with a fibrillar core. We identified microglia that extend their enlarged processes through the diffuse shell of the amyloid plaques and cover the fibrillar plaque core with snowplow-like expanded end-feet. These end-feet were filled with the lysosomal marker CD68, while both non-fibrillar and fibrillar amyloid was found in perinuclear vesicles of some ""snowplower"" microglia. In the organized dense-core plaques, we consistently saw a layer of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) between the fibrillar core and the microglial end-feet. ApoE covered also loose fibrillar amyloid and diffuse amyloid plaques that were about 10 μm or larger in diameter. These findings are compatible with both amyloid plaque phagocytosis and compaction by microglia. Further, they support a chemotactic role of ApoE for microglia contacts with amyloid plaques.",Glia
40103931,Sex-related differences in genetically determined Alzheimer's disease.,"We reviewed the literature on sex differences in genetically determined Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), Down syndrome-associated AD (DSAD), and APOE4 homozygosity, particularly regarding disease penetrance, symptom onset and clinical progression, and trajectories for markers of amyloidosis (A), tau pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N). Data suggests that sex differences in disease penetrance, symptom onset, and AT(N) biomarker trajectories are typically subtle for genetically determined AD populations. Noteworthy exceptions, such as increased neurodegeneration in later stages of the disease in females while similar cognitive outcomes, suggest a potential differential cognitive reserve that warrants further investigation. Additionally, the interaction between APOE genotype and sex reveals complex and multifaceted effects in DSAD, with potential implications for ADAD that remain underexplored. The smaller sex differences observed compared to sporadic AD offer insights into the different underlying disease mechanisms in genetically determined AD populations. Future research should prioritize sex-specific investigations in genetically determined AD, focusing on refining methodologies. This includes prioritizing longitudinal designs, adjustment for key confounders, and adherence to sex-specific guidelines.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39824904,Inflammatory biomarkers profiles and cognition among older adults.,"Inflammation plays a major role in cognitive aging. Most studies on peripheral inflammation and cognitive aging focused on selected major inflammatory biomarkers. However, inflammatory markers are regulated and influenced by each other, and it is therefore important to consider a more comprehensive panel of markers to better capture diverse immune pathways and characterize the overall inflammatory profile of individuals. We explored 23 circulating inflammatory biomarkers using data from 1,743 participants without dementia (≥ 65 years-old) from the community-based, multiethnic Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we developed six inflammatory profiles (PC-1 to PC-6) based on these 23 biomarkers and tested the association of resulting inflammatory profile with cognitive decline, over up to 12 years of follow-up. PC-1 described a pro-inflammatory profile characterized by high positive loadings for pro-inflammatory biomarkers. A higher PC-1 score was associated with lower baseline cognitive performances. No association of this profile with cognitive decline was observed in longitudinal analysis. However, PC-5 characterized by high PDGF-AA and RANTES was associated with a faster cognitive decline. Among older adults, a circulating pro-inflammatory immune profile is associated with lower baseline cognitive performance, and some specific pro-inflammatory cytokines might be associated with faster cognitive decline.",Scientific reports
38823000,Pyroptosis Signature Gene CHMP4B Regulates Microglia Pyroptosis by Inhibiting GSDMD in Alzheimer's Disease.,"In this study, we aimed to work through the key genes involved in the process of pyroptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to identify potential biomarkers using bioinformatics technology and further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. The transcriptome data of brain tissue in AD patients were screened from the GEO database, and pyroptosis-related genes were analyzed. The functions of differential genes were analyzed by enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction. The diagnostic model was established using LASSO and logistic regression analysis, and the correlation of clinical data was analyzed. Based on single-cell analysis of brain tissues of patients with AD, immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to explore the key cells affected by the hub gene. After GSEA, qRT-PCR, western blotting, LDH, ROS, and JC-1 were used to investigate the potential mechanism of the hub gene on pyroptosis. A total of 15 pyroptosis differentially expressed genes were identified. A prediction model consisting of six genes was established by LASSO and logistic regression analysis, and the area under the curve was up to 0.81. As a hub gene, CHMP4B was negatively correlated with the severity of AD. CHMP4B expression was decreased in the hippocampal tissue of patients with AD and mice. Single-cell analysis showed that CHMP4B was downregulated in AD microglia. Overexpression of CHMP4B reduced the release of LDH and ROS and restored mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response during microglial pyroptosis. In summary, CHMP4B as a hub gene provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Molecular neurobiology
40364847,The role of monocytes and macrophages in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuroinflammation. Monocytes and macrophages, particularly microglia, play a dual role in AD pathogenesis. In the early stages, they delay disease progression by phagocytosing Aβ, but chronic activation leads to Aβ accumulation and exacerbated neuroinflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is a key regulator in neuroinflammation, Aβ deposition, and tau pathology, making it a potential therapeutic target. Moreover, recent breakthroughs in fluid and imaging biomarkers and targeted immunomodulatory agents underscore the growing importance of early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. This review explores the complex interplay between monocytes, macrophages, and AD pathology, highlighting their roles in neuroinflammation, Aβ metabolism, and tau phosphorylation. Understanding these mechanisms offers new insights into developing effective diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for AD.",Frontiers in immunology
40207045,Assessing diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease versus cognitively unimpaired individuals: P-tau217 emerges as the optimal marker in Chinese cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: The Simoa platform is recognized as a highly sensitive tool for detecting blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is extensively utilized in the diagnosis and identification of AD, with accuracy emerging as a pivotal metric for assessing assay performance, gradually gaining acceptance and application. The primary objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic efficacy of multiple biomarkers in AD using the Simoa platform. The ultimate goal was to identify the optimal diagnostic biomarkers and further investigate their practical application value in the Chinese population. METHODS: The study comprised two cohorts: cohort I consisted of 151 healthy controls and 90 AD patients, while cohort II was sourced from a Chinese population cohort, encompassing 123 healthy controls and 126 AD patients, utilizing publicly available data. All patients underwent plasma biomarker concentration measurements using the Simoa platform. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of these biomarkers for AD diagnosis were compared to evaluate their diagnostic efficacy. RESULTS: The findings revealed that plasma P-tau217 exhibited excellent performance in differentiating AD from healthy controls, with a sensitivity of 95.0%, specificity of 96.0%, and accuracy of 95.7% for AD diagnosis. Conversely, other indicators, including Aβ42, Aβ42/40, T-tau/Aβ42, P-tau217/Aβ42 and P-tau181, demonstrated some diagnostic efficacy but fell short of meeting the diagnostic criteria. DISCUSSION: P-tau217 stands out as a highly effective biomarker for distinguishing AD from CUC, exhibiting extensive clinical application potential in the Chinese population. It presents a promising array of clinical prospects for the Chinese population.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39936177,Predicting survival rate by plasma biomarkers and clinical variables in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"INTRODUCTION: Modeling the survival rate in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is essential to assess disease trajectories. METHODS: In 262 patients with FTLD, we considered plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived tau, phosphorylated tau217 and amyloid beta (Aβ42/Aβ40). The FTLD Survival Score (FTLD-SS) was calculated by the β coefficients of the variables independently associated with survival rate. RESULTS: Increased plasma NfL levels (p < 0.001), older age at evaluation (p = 0.002), positive family history (p = 0.04), and motor phenotypes (p < 0.001) were associated with reduced survival. The predictive validity of FTLD-SS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.91) at 1 year. DISCUSSION: Survival rate in FTLD is shaped by intensity of neurodegeneration (using plasma NfL as proxy) together with certain clinical variables. The FTLD-SS may serve as a simple tool for survival rate estimation and for patient stratification in clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma neurofilament light chain and clinical variables can predict survival in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-associated syndromes. FTLD Survival Score (FTLD-SS), computed with survival predictors, may serve as a simple tool for patient stratification. FTLD-SS is associated with greater atrophy in frontal and putamen areas.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

METHODS: Thirty-three different p-tau assays measured paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 40 participants (25 with ""AD pathology"" and 15 with ""non-AD pathology"" by CSF amyloid beta [Aβ]42/Aβ40 and p-tau181 criteria). Four CRMs were assessed. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 demonstrated higher fold-changes between AD and non-AD than other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 provided the highest fold-changes. Plasma p-tau217 showed the strongest correlations between plasma assays (rho = 0.81-0.97). The CRMs were not commutable across assays. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 showed larger fold-changes and better accuracy for detecting AD pathology in symptomatic individuals, with greater cross-platform agreement than other p-tau variants. Further work is needed to develop suitable CRMs facilitating cross-assay standardization. HIGHLIGHTS: Paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from twenty-five Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 15 non-AD patients were measured blind. Thirty-three plasma assays were compared, for phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181), 205, 212, 217 and 231. Plasma p-tau217 consistently had the highest fold-change and was best correlated between assays. Plasma-CSF correlations were weak to moderate. There was lack of commutability for four candidate reference materials.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39891995,Synapse vulnerability and resilience underlying Alzheimer's disease.,"Synapse preservation is key for healthy cognitive ageing, and synapse loss represents a critical anatomical basis of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), predicting dementia onset, severity, and progression. Synapse loss is viewed as a primary pathologic event, preceding neuronal loss and brain atrophy in AD. Synapses may, therefore, represent one of the earliest and clinically most meaningful targets of the neuropathologic processes driving AD dementia. The synapse loss in AD is highly selective and targets particularly vulnerable synapses while leaving others, termed resilient, largely unaffected. Yet, the anatomic and molecular hallmarks of the vulnerable and resilient synapse populations and their association with AD neuropathologic changes (e.g. amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles) and memory dysfunction remain poorly understood. Characterising the selectively vulnerable and resilient synapses in AD may be key to understanding the mechanisms of cognitive preservation versus loss and enable the development of robust biomarkers and disease-modifying therapies for dementia.",EBioMedicine
39625101,Plasma p-tau immunoassays in clinical research for Alzheimer's disease.,"The revised biomarker framework for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies as core markers, and markers for adjacent pathophysiology, such as neurodegeneration and inflammation. Many of the core fluid biomarkers are phosphorylated tau (p-tau) fragments, with p-tau217 showing a prominent association with Aβ and tau. While positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is well established, plasma p-tau assays are newer and likely to reduce the use of expensive, and less accessible cerebrospinal fluid and PET imaging tests, thereby promoting wider access to AD screening. There is a need for greater understanding of how the various plasma p-tau species reflect different pathological processes of AD and how different immunoassays perform. This review surveys the available immunoassays and highlights their strengths and limitations in different contexts of use. Assays need to be standardized to maximize their impact on AD clinical research, and patient diagnosis and management. HIGHLIGHTS: Different plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species reflect different pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with p-tau231 showing the greatest association with the earliest increases in brain amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, while p-tau217 shows greater association with both brain Aβ and early tau pathology, and other p-tau and tau fragment species show greater association with later stages of brain tau pathology. Plasma p-tau217 has proven to be an excellent biomarker for AD pathology due to its close association with both brain Aβ and tau pathology, as well as its large dynamic range. Many different assays with varying performance exist for the same p-tau species, with mass spectrometry assays performing uniformly well, and several immunoassays achieving comparable performance. ""Round robin"" head-to-head studies have been performed to compare different assays for several key plasma biomarkers, including p-tau181 and p-tau217, but additional head-to-head studies are needed, especially for new analytes and for measuring performance in diverse populations. Plasma immunoassays have the potential to increase accessibility of early diagnostic testing for a broad population, including diverse historically under-represented and under-served populations, due to the potential to be implemented globally, including in primary care settings; however, further research is needed to validate the optimal cutoffs for each assay for real-world clinical usage. Eventually, clinical implementation of a two-step workflow may allow standalone use of plasma testing in certain contexts, minimizing the need for confirmation with costly and less accessible cerebrospinal fluid/positron emission tomography testing.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39825066,Association between herpes simplex virus infection and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: analysis within the MAPT trial.,"In vitro and animal studies have suggested that inoculation with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can lead to amyloid deposits, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and/or neuronal loss. Here, we studied the association between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in humans. Our sample included 182 participants at risk of cognitive decline from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial who had HSV-1 plasma serology and an amyloid PET scan. Plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain and p-tau181 were also available for a sub-sample of participants. Multivariate linear regressions were performed and stratified by APOE4 genotype. The median age was 74.0 years, 85.2% were infected with HSV-1. Infected participants tended to have a lower cortical amyloid load than uninfected participants (β = -0.08, p = 0.06), especially those suspected of reactivating HSV-1 most frequently (i.e. with a high anti-HSV-1 IgG level; n = 58, β = -0.09 p = 0.04). After stratification, the association was only significant in APOE4 carriers (n = 43, β = -0.21 p = 0.01). No association was found with the plasma biomarkers. The trend toward lower cortical amyloid load in HSV-1-infected participants was unexpected given the pre-existing literature and may be explained either by a modified immune response in HSV-1 infected subjects which could favour the clearance of amyloid deposits or by a selection bias.",Scientific reports
39626853,Extracellular vesicle-packed microRNAs profiling in Alzheimer's disease: The molecular intermediary between pathology and diagnosis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), referring to a type of non-coding RNAs functioning in various biological processes, participate in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through increasing amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, enhancing Tau phosphorylation, and inducing neuroinflammation. Meanwhile, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been suggested as promising carriers of AD biomarkers as they possess the ability to transmit information from cerebral tissue to peripheral blood. Inspired by the above findings, we in this review systematically generalized the roles of miRNAs in AD and explored the potential of EV-packed miRNA as biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Through the detailed investigation, this review may highlight the promise of EV-packed miRNAs in advancing our understanding of AD, and underscore the imperative needs of further studies on their diagnostic potential.",Ageing research reviews
39981456,"The Role of PET Detection of Biomarkers in Early Diagnosis, Progression, and Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurologic disease characterized by the deposition of Aβ amyloid and tau protein in the neural tissue, which leads to gradual and irreversible deterioration of memory. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed high potential in diagnosing AD. It provided a unique opportunity to assess cerebral amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangle deposits in the brain tissue without invasive procedures in vivo. Many studies have been focused on PET diagnosis of AD in recent years, which has significantly improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. This review study aims to summarize the role and emphasize the benefits of PET detection of AD biomarkers in early stages, clinical and histological progression assessment, and predicting AD outcomes. Relevant articles published in the last five years, from September 1, 2019, to October 30, 2024, were searched through authentic databases such as PubMed, PubMed Central, Europe PubMed Central, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. In this systematic review, we included articles published in English, with available full text, based on human trials, with relevant information regarding participants who underwent PET of the brain to diagnose AD biomarkers. The study strictly followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and recommendations. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal methods were used to evaluate all selected cross-sectional research, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the cohort and longitudinal studies. Eleven relevant articles were included in this systematic review, and 2,203 males and females participated. The study revealed that the detection of beta-amyloid PET showed high-precious results in early diagnosis of AD. The detection of tau protein showed a high potential for estimation of the clinical and histological progression and prognosis of AD in longitudinal studies. Identifying amyloid and tau protein accumulation and glucose metabolism alterations is highly predictive of neurodegeneration in preclinical and mild cognitive impairment stages.",Cureus

39796211,Resting-State EEG Alpha Rhythms Are Related to CSF Tau Biomarkers in Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.,"Patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (ADMCI) typically show abnormally high delta (<4 Hz) and low alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms measured from resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) activity. Here, we hypothesized that the abnormalities in rsEEG activity may be greater in ADMCI patients than in those with MCI not due to AD (noADMCI). Furthermore, they may be associated with the diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-tau biomarkers in ADMCI patients. An international database provided clinical-demographic-rsEEG datasets for cognitively unimpaired older (Healthy; N = 45), ADMCI (N = 70), and noADMCI (N = 45) participants. The rsEEG rhythms spanned individual delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. The eLORETA freeware estimated cortical rsEEG sources. Posterior rsEEG alpha source activities were reduced in the ADMCI group compared not only to the Healthy group but also to the noADMCI group (p < 0.001). Negative associations between the CSF phospho-tau and total tau levels and posterior rsEEG alpha source activities were observed in the ADMCI group (p < 0.001), whereas those with CSF amyloid beta 42 levels were marginal. These results suggest that neurophysiological brain neural oscillatory synchronization mechanisms regulating cortical arousal and vigilance through rsEEG alpha rhythms are mainly affected by brain tauopathy in ADMCI patients.",International journal of molecular sciences

39989078,Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarker relationships with incident abnormal amyloid PET.,"INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on the utility of plasma biomarkers to predict incident abnormal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). In this study we evaluate the association of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers with amyloid PET progression among initially amyloid PET negative (A-) individuals. METHODS: We included 290 A-, cognitively unimpaired Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants. We estimated the association of each baseline plasma biomarker with progression from A- to A+ and with rate of amyloid PET change. RESULTS: Interquartile range differences in amyloid beta 42/40, percent phosphorylated tau 217 (%p-tau217), and Amyloid Probability Score 2 were associated with 1.29 (P = 0.09), 1.38 (P < 0.001), and 1.20 (P = 0.05) increases, respectively, in the hazard of progression from A- to A+ and 0.27 (P = 0.16), 0.50 (P = 0.007), and 0.28 (P = 0.15) Centiloid/year increases, respectively, in annual rate of amyloid PET change. DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 may be a useful screening tool to enrich for participants with increased likelihood of progressing from normal to abnormal amyloid PET in a primary prevention trial. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 was associated with amyloid positron emission tomography progression, negative to positive. The associations were weaker for amyloid beta 42/40 and Amyloid Probability Score 2. Age and apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership were also important predictors. These markers may be useful for enrichment of a primary prevention trial.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39641408,Influence of medical conditions on the diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) can enable early detection of brain amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology in cognitively unimpaired individuals. However, the extent to which common medical conditions affect biomarker performance remains unclear. METHODS: Participants (n = 348) included individuals without cognitive impairment. We studied how brain Aβ associated with BBMs (Aβ42/40, phosphorylated tau [p-tau] 181 and 217, p-tau217/Aβ42, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], and neurofilament light [NfL]) and optimal BBM thresholds for predicting brain Aβ positivity and whether they are obscured by the presence of common medical conditions. RESULTS: Plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau217, and GFAP, but not NfL, were significantly associated with brain Aβ. P-tau217/Aβ42 showed the best discriminative performance (area under the curve: 0.91). The strength of p-tau217-brain Aβ associations were obscured by diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. DISCUSSION: These results suggest BBMs may help detect early Aβ pathology but suggest caution in their use due to common medical conditions that could affect accuracy. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau217, and GFAP but not NfL showed significant associations with brain Aβ. BBMs were more strongly associated with the level of brain Aβ in those without diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. P-tau217/Aβ42 showed the best performance (AUC = 0.91) in discriminating Aβ presence with an optimal cut-off of >1.2, followed by p-tau217 at >0.46 pg/mL, with performance slightly improving when excluding participants with cardiovascular conditions.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39992249,The role of insulin resistance and APOE genotype on blood-brain barrier integrity in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence suggests a connection between insulin resistance and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but the mechanisms are unclear. We examined effects of insulin resistance and APOE genotype on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in AD. METHODS: BBB integrity was measured in 196 biologically-confirmed non-diabetic patients with AD evaluating CSF/serum albumin ratio, kappa and lambda free light chains (FLCs). Insulin resistance was assessed using triglyceride-glucose index (TyG). The impact of TyG on BBB integrity, and its interaction with APOE genotypes, was analyzed using multivariate models. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of patients with AD showed altered TyG, with the 21.8% classified as high TyG. TyG subgroups were associated with BBB abnormalities, with similar AD clinical and biomarkers profile. A significant interaction between TyG and APOE ε4/ε4 genotype on BBB permeability was found in multivariate analyses. DISCUSSION: Insulin resistance is a common feature in non-diabetic AD and correlates with altered BBB permeability, interacting synergistically with APOE genotype. HIGHLIGHTS: Insulin resistance and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype are well-recognized risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin resistance shows high prevalence in patients with AD. Insulin resistance is related to damage in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. The association between the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and BBB permeability varies in relation to APOE genotype; patients with the APOE ε4/ε4 displayed higher BBB permeability.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39754932,Sex-specific associations of neurodegeneration and inflammatory biomarkers with intrinsic capacity in older adults: Findings from the 4-year longitudinal Multidomain Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT).,"This four-year longitudinal study investigated whether the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of inflammation-related and neurodegenerative-related blood biomarkers with intrinsic capacity differ according to sex. The sample comprised 1117 older adults (<70 years, 63.8 % females) from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT). The domains of intrinsic capacity were operationalized as cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), locomotion (Short Physical Performance Battery), vitality (Handgrip Strength), and psychological well-being (Geriatric Depression Scale), each scaled from 0 (worst intrinsic capacity possible) to 100 (best intrinsic capacity possible). Plasma biomarkers included interleukin 6 (picograms per milliliter), growth differentiation factor-15 (picograms per milliliter), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (picograms per milliliter), neurofilament light chain (picograms per milliliter), progranulin (nanograms per milliliter), and amyloid-beta ratio. Linear mixed models were analyzed to examine whether sex modified the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between biomarkers and intrinsic capacity. No significant interaction effect was observed at baseline. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant interaction between sex and interleukin 6 (p = .005), such that higher levels of interleukin 6 tended to be associated with a faster decline in intrinsic capacity for males (B = -0.385; p = .055; 95 % CI = -0.778; 0.008) but not for females (B = 0.287; p = .041; 95 % CI = 0.011; 0.563). The other biomarkers had no sex-dependent associations with intrinsic capacity. A potential sex-dependent effect of the inflammatory status on intrinsic capacity must be further investigated.

40028337,Pathogenesis and therapeutic applications of microglia receptors in Alzheimer's disease.,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, continuously monitor the brain's microenvironment through their array of specific receptors. Once brain function is altered, microglia are recruited to specific sites to perform their immune functions, including phagocytosis of misfolded proteins, cellular debris, and apoptotic cells to maintain homeostasis. When toxic substances are overproduced, microglia are over-activated to produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induce chronic inflammatory responses and lead to neurotoxicity. Additionally, microglia can also monitor and protect neuronal function through microglia-neuron crosstalk. Microglia receptors are important mediators for microglia to receive external stimuli, regulate the functional state of microglia, and transmit signals between cells. In this paper, we first review the role of microglia-expressed receptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease; moreover, we emphasize the complexity of targeting microglia for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative disorders to inform the discovery of new biomarkers and the development of innovative therapeutics.",Frontiers in immunology
39788041,Association of body composition with neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive function; a population-based study of 70-year-olds.,"BACKGROUND: A better understanding of body-brain links may provide insights on targets for preventing cognitive decline. The aim was to explore associations of body composition with neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive function among dementia-free 70-year-olds. METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry body composition measures in relation to neuroimaging measures of cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, small vessel disease, predicted brain age, and cognitive performance were explored in a cross-sectional study of 674 dementia-free 70-year-olds from the Swedish Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort study. Linear or ordinal regression analyses were performed. FINDINGS: Higher quantity of muscle mass was associated with lower predicted brain age (β: -0.31 [95% CI: -0.45, -0.16], p: 0.00013). Those with normal level muscle mass (>7.0 men, >5.5 women kg/height m(2)) had overall thicker cortex (β: 0.043 [95% CI: 0.023, 0.064], p: 0.00016), thicker cortex in Alzheimer's disease signature regions (β: 0.051 [95% CI: 0.025, 0.076], p: 0.00040), and larger hippocampal volume (β: 111.52 [95% CI: 25.28, 197.75], p: 0.030) compared to those with sarcopenic level muscle mass. Higher accumulation of visceral fat was associated with overall thinner cortex (β: -0.017 [95% CI: -0.028, -0.005], p: 0.024). Faster gait speed and higher handgrip strength were associated with indicators of better brain health. INTERPRETATION: Improving muscle mass fitness and lower visceral fat may be beneficial for brain health. Intervention studies are needed to confirm that targeting body composition can promote healthy brain ageing and reduce the risk of cognitive impairment among older adults.

38795302,Smoking Impacts Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Oral Microbiota Modulation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important public health challenge with a limited understanding of its pathogenesis. Smoking is a significant modifiable risk factor for AD progression, and its specific mechanism is often interpreted from a toxicological perspective. However, microbial infections also contribute to AD, with oral microbiota playing a crucial role in its progression. Notably, smoking alters the ecological structure and pathogenicity of the oral microbiota. Currently, there is no systematic review or summary of the relationship between these three factors; thus, understanding this association can help in the development of new treatments. This review summarizes the connections between smoking, AD, and oral microbiota from existing research. It also explores how smoking affects the occurrence and development of AD through oral microbiota, and examines treatments for oral microbiota that delay the progression of AD. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the potential of the oral microbiota to act as a biomarker for AD. Finally, it considers the feasibility of probiotics and oral antibacterial therapy to expand treatment methods for AD.",Molecular neurobiology
39575854,Plasma pTau217 ratio predicts continuous regional brain tau accumulation in amyloid-positive early Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: This study examines whether phosphorylated plasma Tau217 ratio (pTau217R) can predict tau accumulation in different brain regions, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), for staging Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Plasma pTau217R was measured using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Models for predicting tau PET SUVR, developed with 144 early AD individuals using [(18)F]MK6240, were validated in two validation sets, VS1 (98 early AD) and VS2 (47 preclinical/early AD with a different tracer, flortaucipir (Tauvid)), all amyloid-beta positive (Aβ+). RESULTS: The pTau217R-based model predicted tau levels up to an SUVR of 2 in multiple brain regions, effectively assessing tau status at different tau levels with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas of 0.84-0.95 in VS1 and 0.71-0.88 in VS2 (using a different tracer). It reduced PET scan needs by 65% while maintaining 95% sensitivity. DISCUSSION: PTau217R reliably predicts regional tau accumulation in early AD, reducing reliance on tau PET scans and broadening its clinical application. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03887455 (ClarityAD) HIGHLIGHTS: Developed a model using plasma pTau217R to predict tau levels across brain regions. pTau217R model outperformed models based on clinical, MRI, and other blood biomarkers. The model reliably predicted tau levels exceeding tau positivity and higher thresholds. Screening with pTau217R could reduce tau PET scans by 65% at 95% sensitivity. pTau217R model aids in disease staging and monitoring in early AD.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39674375,Targeting tau in Alzheimer's and beyond: Insights into pathology and therapeutic strategies.,"Tauopathies encompass a group of approximately 20 neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in brain neurons. The pathogenesis of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of tauopathies, is initiated by hyperphosphorylated tau protein isoforms that cause neuronal death and lead to diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other complex neurodegenerative diseases. Current applications of tau biomarkers, including imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-based assays, assist in the evaluation and diagnosis of tauopathies. Emerging research is providing various potential strategies to prevent cellular toxicity caused by tau aggregation such as: 1) suppressing toxic tau aggregation, 2) preventing post-translational modifications of tau, 3) stabilizing microtubules and 4) designing tau-directed immunogens. This review aims to discuss the role of tau in tauopathies along with neuropathological features of the different tauopathies and the new developments in treating tau aggregation with the therapeutics for treating and possibly preventing tauopathies.",Ageing research reviews
39740121,Paving the way for Alzheimer's disease blood-based biomarkers in primary care.,"Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have the potential to revolutionize the detection and management of cognitive impairment. AD BBBMs are not currently recommended for use in primary care but may soon be as research demonstrates their clinical utility for differential diagnosis and patient management. To prepare for the incorporation of AD BBBMs into primary care, several practical challenges must be addressed. Here, we describe four immediate challenges: (1) preparing primary care providers to order and disclose AD BBBMs, (2) expanding the dementia-capable workforce, (3) ensuring equitable uptake of AD BBBM testing, and (4) securing access to AD treatment. We conclude by discussing future directions and challenges for use of AD BBBMs in primary care, including screening for preclinical AD and dementia detection algorithms. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may be well suited for primary care. Many changes are needed to prepare the workforce and ensure patient access.

39571410,"Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships among blood-brain barrier disruption, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and cognition in cognitively normal older adults.","Blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBd) occurs in aging, particularly in regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, its relationship to pathological protein accumulation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in normal aging is unclear. We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in cognitively normal older adults to explore how BBBd correlates with brain atrophy and cognitive function, and whether these relationships are influenced by Aβ or tau. We found that greater BBBd in the hippocampus (HC) and an averaged BBBd-susceptible ROI were linked to worse episodic memory, with interactions between BBBd and atrophy influencing this relationship, independent of Aβ and tau. However, there were no significant relationships between BBBd and non-memory cognitive performance. In participants with longitudinal AD biomarker and cognitive data acquired prior to DCE-MRI, faster longitudinal entorhinal cortex (EC) tau accumulation and episodic memory decline were associated with greater HC BBBd, independent of global Aβ changes and regional atrophy. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between AD biomarkers, cognitive decline, and BBBd.",Neurobiology of aging
39441698,New criteria to predict LATE-NC in the clinical setting: Probable/Possible LATE and LANS.,"This review discusses terminology recently proposed for the classification of dementia and, more specifically, nosology related to aging-associated TDP-43 pathology: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS). While the ""gold standard"" for these clinical conditions is still LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC), clinical criteria and biomarkers are evolving. The newly proposed clinical rubrics are discussed with emphasis on the need for terminology that acknowledges the distinctions between clinical syndrome-, molecular biomarker-, and pathologically defined disease concepts. As further progress is made on research into the specific biomarker-based detection and prediction of TDP-43 proteinopathy in the clinical setting, the definitions of ""Probable"" and ""Possible"" LATE are likely to become more useful clinically.

39893139,"Use of lecanemab and donanemab in the Canadian healthcare system: Evidence, challenges, and areas for future research.","Lecanemab and donanemab are monoclonal antibody therapies that remove amyloid-beta from the brain. They are the first therapies that alter a fundamental mechanism, amyloid-beta deposition, in Alzheimer disease (AD). To inform Canadian decisions on approval and use of these drugs, the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging commissioned Work Groups to review evidence on the efficacy and safety of these new therapies, as well as their projected impacts on Canadian dementia systems of care. We included persons with lived experience with Alzheimer disease in the discussion about the benefits and harms. Our review of the trial publications found high quality evidence of statistically significant group differences, but also recognized that there are mixed views on the clinical relevance of the observed differences and the value of therapy for individual patients. The drugs are intended for persons with early AD, at a stage of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. If patients are treated, then confirmation of AD by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid analysis and monitoring for risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities was recommended, as done in the clinical trials, although it would strain Canadian resource capacity. More data are needed to determine the size of the potentially eligible treatment population in Canada.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39998851,Impact of the polygenic risk scores for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies indicate a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and elevated risk of dementia. However, the impact of ADHD on cognition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in individuals with cognitive impairment remains unclear. METHODS: We computed weighted ADHD polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS) in 938 cognitively impaired participants (674 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 264 dementia; mean age 73.5 years). A subset underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET). RESULTS: We observed lower executive function in individuals with high ADHD-PRS for both MCI and dementia participants. Higher levels of CSF phosphorylated tau, but not Aβ, were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. Increased ADHD-PRS was associated with glucose hypometabolism in the frontal and parietal cortices. DISCUSSION: ADHD-PRS is associated with a more severe disease presentation in individuals with cognitive impairment due to dementia, characterized by impaired executive function, elevated tau pathology, and hypometabolism in the frontal and parietal cortices. HIGHLIGHTS: We calculated the genetic liability for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS). Elevated ADHD-PRS was associated with executive function deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau, but not amyloid beta (Aβ), were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with brain hypometabolism in individuals with AD dementia. Hypometabolism in the parietal cortex mediated the effects of ADHD-PRS on executive function.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39891246,Glymphatic system clearance and Alzheimer's disease risk: a CSF proteome-wide study.,"BACKGROUND: The emerging evidence of the role of the glymphatic system (GS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides new opportunities for intervention from the earliest stages of the disease. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of GS in AD to identify new disease biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a two-stage proteomic study to evaluate the GS health using intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) with serial T1 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). In Stage 1 (evaluated in the Cohort 1 of aMCI participants (n = 11)), we correlated the levels of 7K cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins (estimated by SOMAscan) with GS health in 78 Freesurfer-segmented brain regions of interest (ROIs). RESULTS: A total of seven different proteins were significantly associated with GS health (p-value < 6.4 × 10(-4)). The stronger correlations were identified for NSUN6, GRAAK, OLFML3, ACTN2, RUXF, SHPS1 and TIM-4. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins associated with GS health were mainly implicated in neurodegenerative processes, immunity and inflammation. In Stage 2, we validated these proteomic results in a new cohort of aMCI participants (with and without evidence of AD pathology in CSF (aMCI(-) and aMCI/AD( +); n = 22 and 7, respectively) and healthy controls (n = 10). Proteomic prediction models were generated in each ROI. These were compared with demographic-only models for identifying participants with aMCI(-) and aMCI/AD( +) vs controls. This analysis was repeated to determine if the models could identify those with aMCI/AD( +) from both aMCI(-) and controls. The proteomic models were found to outperform the demographic-only models. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies proteins linked with GS health and involved the immune system in aMCI participants.",Alzheimer's research & therapy

METHODS: We examined this in a Singaporean memory clinic cohort of 528 subjects (n = 300, CeVD; n = 167, incident cognitive decline) followed-up for 4 years. RESULTS: Of 1441 plasma proteins surveyed, a 12-protein signature significantly predicted cognitive decline (q-value < .05). Sixteen diverse biological processes were implicated in cognitive decline. Ten proteins independently predicted incident dementia (q-value < .05). A unified prediction model combining plasma proteins with clinical risk factors increased the area under the curve for outcome prediction from 0.62 to 0.85. External validation in the cerebrospinal fluid proteome of an independent Caucasian cohort replicated four of the significantly predictive plasma markers for cognitive decline namely: GFAP, NEFL, AREG, and PPY. DISCUSSION: The prognostic proteins prioritized in our study provide robust signals in two different biological matrices, representing potential mechanistic targets for dementia and cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: A total of 1441 plasma proteins were profiled in a Singaporean memory clinic cohort. We report prognostic plasma protein signatures for cognitive decline and dementia. External validation was performed in the cerebrospinal fluid proteome of a Caucasian cohort. A concordant proteomic signature was identified across both biofluids and cohorts.

Current treatments aim to manage symptoms, but they are not effective in stopping the progression of the disease. New drug targets are needed to prevent Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to study drug targets for Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed data from the European Alzheimer's and Dementia Biobank consortium and replicated our findings in GWAS data from IGAP and FinnGen cohorts. We identified genetic instruments for plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and conducted sensitivity analyses using various methods. Additionally, a comparison and analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) were conducted to identify potential causal proteins. The implications of these findings were further explored through an examination of existing AD drugs and their respective targets. RESULTS: Through MR analysis, 10 protein AD pairs were identified as statistically significant at the Bonferroni level (P < 6.35 × 10(-5)). The specific findings indicate that elevated levels of plasma cathepsin H (CTSH) (OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.03-1.08, p = 6.12 × 10(-6)), plasma signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) (OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.02-1.05, p = 1.37 × 10(-5)), plasma TMEM106B (OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.09-1.23, p = 1.92 × 10(-6)), and CSF bone sialoprotein (BSP) (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.17-1.51, p = 9.34 × 10(-6)), CSF Interleukin-34 (IL-34) (OR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.51-3.01, p = 1.85 × 10(-5)), CSF immunoglobulin-like transcript 2 (ILT-2) (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.17-1.51, p = 9.34 × 10(-6)) are associated with an increased risk of AD, while increased levels of plasma progranulin gene (GRN) (OR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.74-0.84, p = 2.19 × 10(-12)), plasma triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.58-0.78, p = 6.95 × 10(-8)), plasma sialic acid-bind immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLEC)-9 (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.58-0.78, p = 6.95 × 10(-8)), and CSF SIGLEC7 (OR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.28-0.64, p = 4.30 × 10(-5)) are associated with a decreased risk of AD. Bayesian colocalization found that the above protein-related genes shared the same mutation as AD. CONCLUSION: Increased levels of plasma CTSH, SIRPA, TMEM106B, CSF BSP, CSF IL-34, and CSF ILT-2 have been found to be correlated with an elevated risk of AD, whereas elevated levels of plasma GRN, TREM2, SIGLEC9, and CSF SIGLEC7 are associated with a decreased risk of developing AD.

39827337,Chitinase-3-like-1: a multifaceted player in neuroinflammation and degenerative pathologies with therapeutic implications.,"Chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein involved in key biological processes, including tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and neuroinflammation. It has emerged as a significant player in various neurodegenerative diseases and brain disorders. Elevated CHI3L1 levels have been observed in neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), HIV-associated dementia (HAD), Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS), and brain tumors. This review explores the role of CHI3L1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders, with a focus on its contributions to neuroinflammation, immune cell infiltration, and neuronal degeneration. As a key regulator of neuroinflammation, CHI3L1 modulates microglia and astrocyte activity, driving the release of proinflammatory cytokines that exacerbate disease progression. In addition to its role in disease pathology, CHI3L1 has emerged as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of brain disorders. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CHI3L1 have been linked to disease severity and cognitive decline, particularly in AD and MS, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies targeting CHI3L1, such as small-molecule inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies, have shown promise in preclinical studies, demonstrating reduced neuroinflammation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and improved neuronal survival. Despite its therapeutic potential, challenges remain in developing selective and safe CHI3L1-targeted therapies, particularly in ensuring effective delivery across the blood-brain barrier and mitigating off-target effects. This review addresses the complexities of targeting CHI3L1, highlights its potential in precision medicine, and outlines future research directions aimed at unlocking its full therapeutic potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases and brain pathologies.",Molecular neurodegeneration
39181294,Interval-specific likelihood ratios and probability-based models for interpreting combined CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker panel is commonly interpreted with binary cutoff values. However, these values are not generic and do not reflect the disease continuum. We explored the use of interval-specific likelihood ratios (LRs) and probability-based models for AD using a CSF biomarker panel. METHODS: CSF biomarker (Aβ(1-42), tTau and pTau(181)) data for both a clinical discovery cohort of 241 patients (measured with INNOTEST) and a clinical validation cohort of 129 patients (measured with EUROIMMUN), both including AD and non-AD dementia/cognitive complaints were retrospectively retrieved in a single-center study. Interval-specific LRs for AD were calculated and validated for univariate and combined (Aβ(1-42)/tTau and pTau(181)) biomarkers, and a continuous bivariate probability-based model for AD, plotting Aβ(1-42)/tTau versus pTau(181) was constructed and validated. RESULTS: LR for AD increased as individual CSF biomarker values deviated from normal. Interval-specific LRs of a combined biomarker model showed that once one biomarker became abnormal, LRs increased even further when another biomarker largely deviated from normal, as replicated in the validation cohort. A bivariate probability-based model predicted AD with a validated accuracy of 88% on a continuous scale. CONCLUSIONS: Interval-specific LRs in a combined biomarker model and prediction of AD using a continuous bivariate biomarker probability-based model, offer a more meaningful interpretation of CSF AD biomarkers on a (semi-)continuous scale with respect to the post-test probability of AD across different assays and cohorts.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry
39740074,Clinical use of biomarkers in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatments.,"With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well-validated biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of test results may be complex and depends on the pre-test probability and test-specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non-dementia specialists to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39009700,Mitochondrial DNA abundance in blood is associated with Alzheimer's disease- and dementia-risk.,"The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been portrayed through molecular, cellular, and animal studies; however large epidemiological studies are lacking. This study aimed to explore the association of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), a marker representative of mtDNA abundance per cell, with risk of incident all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia diagnosis within 17 years and dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL). Additionally, sex-stratified analyses were completed. In this German population-based cohort study (ESTHER), 9940 participants aged 50-75 years were enrolled by general practitioners and followed for 17 years. Participants were included in this study if information on dementia status and blood-based mtDNAcn measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction were available. In a nested case-control approach, a subsample of participants additionally had measurements of P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL in blood samples taken at baseline. Of 4913 participants eligible for analyses, 386 were diagnosed with incident all-cause dementia, including 130 AD and 143 vascular dementia cases, while 4527 participants remained without dementia diagnosis within 17 years. Participants with low mtDNAcn (lowest 10%) experienced 45% and 65% percent increased risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD after adjusting for age and sex (all-cause dementia: HRadj, 95%CI:1.45, 1.08-1.94; AD: HRadj, 95%CI: 1.65, 1.01-2.68). MtDNAcn was not associated to vascular dementia diagnosis and was more strongly associated with all-cause dementia among women. In the nested case-control study (n = 790), mtDNAcn was not significantly associated with the dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) levels in blood from baseline before dementia diagnosis. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence connecting mtDNA abundance, measured via mtDNAcn, to incident dementia and AD at the population-based level. Reduced mitochondrial abundance may play a role in pathogenesis, especially among women.",Molecular psychiatry
39692624,Advancements in Immunity and Dementia Research: Highlights from the 2023 AAIC Advancements: Immunity Conference.,"The immune system is a key player in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. While brain resident immune cell-mediated neuroinflammation and peripheral immune cell (eg, T cell) infiltration into the brain have been shown to significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, the nature and extent of immune responses in the brain in the context of AD and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear. Furthermore, the roles of the peripheral immune system in driving ADRD pathology remain incompletely elucidated. In March of 2023, the Alzheimer's Association convened the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), Advancements: Immunity, to discuss the roles of the immune system in ADRD. A wide range of topics were discussed, such as animal models that replicate human pathology, immune-related biomarkers and clinical trials, and lessons from other fields describing immune responses in neurodegeneration. This manuscript presents highlights from the conference and outlines avenues for future research on the roles of immunity in neurodegenerative disorders. HIGHLIGHTS: The immune system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The immune system exerts numerous effects throughout the brain on amyloid-beta, tau, and other pathways.

39893456,Retinal optical coherence tomography intensity spatial correlation features as new biomarkers for confirmed Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The nature and severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies in the retina and brain correspond. However, retinal biomarkers need to be validated in clinical cohorts with confirmed AD biomarkers and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The main objective of this study was to investigate whether retinal metrics measured by OCT aid in the early screening and brain pathology monitoring for confirmed AD. METHODS: This was a case-control study. All participants underwent retinal OCT imaging, and neurological examinations, including amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography. Participants were subdivided into cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD-derived dementia (ADD). Except retinal thickness, we developed the grey level co-occurrence matrix algorithm to extract retinal OCT intensity spatial correlation features (OCT-ISCF), including angular second matrix (ASM), correlation (COR), and homogeneity (HOM), one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences in retinal parameters among the groups, and to analyze the correlation with brain Aβ plaques and cognitive scores. The repeatability and robustness of OCT-ISCF were evaluated using experimental and simulation methods. RESULTS: This study enrolled 82 participants, subdivided into 20 CN, 22 MCI, and 40 ADD. Compared with the CN, the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer and myoid and ellipsoid zone were significantly thinner (P < 0.05), and ASM, COR, and HOM in several retinal sublayers changed significantly in the ADD (P < 0.05). Notably, the MCI showed significant differences in ASM and COR in the outer segment of photoreceptor compared with the CN (P < 0.05). The changing pattern of OCT-ISCF with interclass correlation coefficients above 0.8 differed from that caused by speckle noise, and was affected by OCT image quality index. Moreover, the retinal OCT-ISCF were more strongly correlated with brain Aβ plaque burden and MoCA scores than retinal thickness. The accuracy using retinal OCT-ISCF (AUC = 0.935, 0.830) was better than that using retinal thickness (AUC = 0.795, 0.705) in detecting ADD and MCI. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that retinal OCT-ISCF enhance the association and detection efficacy of AD pathology compared to retinal thickness, suggesting retinal OCT-ISCF have the potential to be new biomarkers for AD.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
39623197,Emerging Pharmacological Approaches for Psychosis and Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Psychosis and agitation are among the most distressing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD), linked to faster disease progression and earlier admission to nursing homes. While nonpharmacological treatments may alleviate mild behavioral symptoms, more severe syndromes often require pharmacological intervention. Brexpiprazole is the only medication approved for agitation in AD, although its limited clinical efficacy has raised criticism. No drugs have been approved for treating psychosis in AD, highlighting the critical need for new, effective, and safe treatments. Recent studies have elucidated part of the neurobiological basis of NPSs in the AD brain, offering insights for testing repurposed and novel drugs. We conducted a comprehensive nonsystematic literature review, aiming to provide a critical overview of both current treatments and emerging pharmacological interventions under clinical development for treating psychosis and agitation in AD. Additionally, we present strategies to optimize the clinical development of new drug candidates. We identify three promising compounds that are currently in phase 3 trials: xanomeline-trospium for AD psychosis, and dextromethorphan-bupropion and dexmedetomidine for agitation in AD. We propose that biomarkers linked to the neuropsychiatric traits of AD patients should be identified in dedicated studies and then included in phase 2 dose-range-finding studies with novel compounds to establish biological engagement. Furthermore, phase 3 placebo-controlled studies should be carried out in AD biomarker-confirmed subjects with narrower cognitive impairment ranges and precise NPS severity at screening. Alternative study designs, such as sequential phase approaches, may also be adopted.",CNS drugs
39791378,"Associations between lifelong cognitive reserve, Alzheimer's disease-related plasma biomarkers, and cognitive function in dementia-free older adults: A population-based study.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR), typically measured through socio-behavioral proxies, can partially explain better cognitive performance despite underlying brain aging or neuropathology. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of CR with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive function while considering Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related plasma biomarkers. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 4706 dementia-free individuals from MIND-China. Data on AD-related plasma biomarkers were available for 1204 individuals. A composite CR score was generated by integrating education, occupational complexity, mental activity, and social support, using structural equation modeling. A neuropsychological test battery was used to assess the function of episodic memory, executive function, attention, and verbal fluency. MCI and subtypes of MCI were defined according to the Petersen's criteria. Data were analyzed using general linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Controlling for AD-related plasma biomarkers, higher educational attainment was associated with better performance in all four examined cognitive domains (p < 0.001) and with lower likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-aMCI (p < 0.05); late-life mental activity was significantly related to lower likelihoods of MCI and aMCI (p < 0.05). Midlife occupation and late-life social support were not significantly associated with MCI or subtypes (p > 0.05). Higher composite CR scores were related to better performance in all the examined cognitive domains as well as lower likelihoods of MCI, aMCI, and non-aMCI (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greater composite CR, derived from the CR indicators across different stages of the lifespan, is associated with better cognitive function independent of AD-related plasma biomarkers, driven mainly by early-life educational attainment.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39965013,Identification of biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 by bioinformatics combining single-cell data analysis and machine learning algorithms.,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in 2019, COVID-19 has become a global epidemic. Several studies have suggested a link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and COVID-19. However, there is little research into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify key genes in COVID-19 associated with AD, and evaluate their correlation with immune cells characteristics and metabolic pathways. METHODS: Transcriptome analyses were used to identify common biomolecular markers of AD and COVID-19. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed on gene chip datasets (GSE213313, GSE5281, and GSE63060) from AD and COVID-19 patients to identify genes associated with both conditions. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified common molecular mechanisms. The core genes were identified using machine learning. Subsequently, we evaluated the relationship between these core genes and immune cells and metabolic pathways. Finally, our findings were validated through single-cell analysis. RESULTS: The study identified 484 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by taking the intersection of genes between AD and COVID-19. The black module, containing 132 genes, showed the highest association between the two diseases according to WGCNA. GO enrichment analysis revealed that these genes mainly affect inflammation, cytokines, immune-related functions, and signaling pathways related to metal ions. Additionally, a machine learning approach identified eight core genes. We identified links between these genes and immune cells and also found a association between EIF3H and oxidative phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: This study identifies shared genes, pathways, immune alterations, and metabolic changes potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and AD.",PloS one

Here we characterize the baseline data set of the POINTER Imaging ancillary study. METHODS: Participants underwent health and cognitive assessments and neuroimaging with multimodal positron emission tomography (PET) (beta-amyloid [Aβ] and tau) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Framingham risk score (FRS) was used to quantify cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. RESULTS: A total of 1052 participants (31% from underrepresented ethnoracial groups) were enrolled. Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ (29%) participants were older, had higher apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriage rate and white matter hyperintensity volume, and greater temporal tau. FRS was related to MRI measures, but not AD biomarkers. FRS and tau had independent effects on cognition. DISCUSSION: In this heterogenous, at-risk cohort, CVD risk was related to more abnormal brain structure and poorer cognition, representing a putative non-AD (Alzheimer's disease) pathway to brain injury and cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: ·The U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) cohort is enriched for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and poor lifestyle ·POINTER Imaging collected multimodal neuroimaging data in this unique, at-risk cohort ·Amyloid burden was related to age, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriage, and measures of disease progression ·Associations between amyloid and tau, and tau and cognition, were relatively weak ·CVD risk and tau pathology were independently related to memory.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39853561,Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms (BPSD) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD): Development and Treatment.,"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as agitation, apathy, and psychosis, are highly prevalent and have a significant impact on patients and their care partners. The neurobiology of BPSD involves a complex interplay of structural brain changes and alterations in the neurotransmitter system. Various genetic and plasma biomarkers have also been studied. Research in BPSD has been limited by heterogeneity in the diagnostic criteria and assessment tools. As such, there have been ongoing efforts to develop a gold-standard assessment tool and diagnostic criteria. Current practice guidelines recommend nonpharmacological therapies as first-line treatments. Pharmacological options are often used when there is an insufficient response to nonpharmacological strategies, but there can be serious adverse effects with existing pharmacological agents. This has resulted in growing efforts to develop novel therapeutics with more favorable tolerability profiles, with some showing promising results. Other biological therapies, such as neurostimulation, have also demonstrated positive results. As our understanding of BPSD evolves, ongoing research efforts in treatment of BPSD are warranted in order to enhance the quality of life for patients and their care partners.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences
39930671,[Non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in bodily fluids].,"One of the urgent problems of modern health care is Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early diagnosis. This is due to the rapid global spread of AD, the lack of pathogenetic therapy, and the ability to stabilize the progression of cognitive impairment in the early stages of the disease. Currently, only an autopsy can confirm the diagnosis of AD with 100% reliability, and classical laboratory and instrumental methods of diagnosis verification are difficult to implement in routine clinical practice due to several limitations. That is why the study of new and available biomarkers identified in human bodily fluids is promising for the early diagnosis of AD. The review addresses the problem of AD verification using markers in human bodily fluids, which can be obtained in a non-invasive way. Potential biomarkers of AD in saliva, tear fluid, urine, and nasal secretion are reviewed, and their prognostic values as AD indicators in the early stage are evaluated.",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

We systematically reviewed studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and CSF p-tau217, searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science through August 2024. The accuracy of p-tau217 in predicting amyloid and tau pathology on PET was evaluated in 30 studies. Both plasma and CSF p-tau217 effectively detect amyloid and tau PET deposition. Plasma p-tau217 showed 82% sensitivity for detecting amyloid and 83% for tau, with 86% and 83% specificity, respectively. CSF p-tau217 had 79% sensitivity for amyloid and 91% for tau, with 91% and 84% specificity. p-tau217 effectively identifies Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Plasma p-tau217 was comparable to CSF p-tau217 in detecting amyloid deposition on PET. Despite being less sensitive for detecting tau deposition on PET, plasma p-tau217 can be an efficient screening tool for underlying AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) serves as a viable biomarker alternative to cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 due to the strong concordance between their results. Plasma p-tau217 accurately identifies amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) positivity, exhibiting a low rate of false negatives and positives, thereby establishing it as a reliable diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma p-tau217 demonstrates slightly higher accuracy in predicting amyloid PET positivity compared to tau PET positivity. Plasma p-tau217 demonstrates higher predictive accuracy in detecting AD pathology among cognitively impaired individuals, compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals, suggesting its enhanced utility as a diagnostic biomarker in clinical settings.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39783876,Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with worse levels of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in APOE ε4-carrying women: An observational study.,"INTRODUCTION: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), along with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, has been suggested as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between MHT and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers is unknown: we investigated this association, and whether APOE ε4 carrier status moderates it. METHODS: In an observational study of 136 cognitively unimpaired female participants (M(age) = 66.0; standard deviation = 6.3), we examined whether MHT use alone or in interaction with APOE ε4 carrier status was associated with CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid beta (Aβ)40, Aβ42, p-tau/Aβ42, and Aβ42/40 ratios. RESULTS: Significant interactions were found between APOE ε4 and MHT use for CSF biomarkers. APOE ε4 carriers who were MHT users showed worse levels of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratios than all other users and non-users. DISCUSSION: The presence of both APOE ε4 and MHT may be associated with elevated amyloid deposition and AD pathology in this sample of participants who demonstrated high familial AD risk. HIGHLIGHTS: Significant interactions were found between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (p-tau)/amyloid beta (Aβ)42 and Aβ42/40 ratios. APOE ε4 carriers who were MHT users showed worse levels of CSF biomarkers than non-users and non-carriers, both users and non-users. Younger age at MHT initiation was associated with worse levels of the p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratios in carriers only. The presence of both APOE ε4 carriage and MHT use may be associated with elevated amyloid deposition and AD pathology. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the differences observed in the current study.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39764651,"Blood plasma proteomic markers of Alzheimer's disease, current status and application prospects.","INTRODUCTION: Identifying early risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge as the number of patients with AD steadily increases and requires innovative solutions. Current molecular diagnostic modalities, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, exhibit limitations in their applicability for large-scale screening. In recent years, there has been a marked shift toward the development of blood plasma-based diagnostic tests, which offer a more accessible and clinically viable alternative for widespread use. Furthermore, advances in large-scale proteomics technologies have boosted an interest in identifying novel biomarkers and developing panels of AD-associated proteins. AREAS COVERED: This review mainly examines the results of recent searches for proteomic markers of AD in blood plasma (from 2022-2024 PubMed), focuses on some aspects for special attention in further studies, and discusses the prospects for their further application.

39878233,Sleep spindles and slow oscillations predict cognition and biomarkers of neurodegeneration in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Changes in sleep physiology can predate cognitive symptoms by decades in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it remains unclear which sleep characteristics predict cognitive and neurodegenerative changes after AD onset. METHODS: Using data from a prospective cohort of mild to moderate AD (n = 60), we analyzed non-rapid eye movement sleep spindles and slow oscillations (SOs) at baseline and their associations with baseline amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau and with cognition from baseline to 3-year follow-up. RESULTS: Higher spindle and SO activity predicted significant changes in Aβ and tau at baseline, lower Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (better cognitive performance) score, and higher Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to 36 months. Spindles and SOs mediated the effect of phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181)/Aβ42 on cognition, while pTau181/aβ42 moderated the effect of spindles and SOs on cognition. DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that spindle and SO activity during sleep constitute predictive and non-invasive biomarkers of neurodegeneration and cognition in AD patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Sleep spindles predict long-term cognitive performance in AD. Sleep spindle and SOs can be predictive, non-invasive biomarkers for AD. Sleep may be one of the most important modifiable risk factors for AD progression. Sleep microarchitecture is a novel therapeutic target for preserving brain heath. Sleep physiology can provide novel therapeutic targets to slow AD progression.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39671543,"Phase 2A Proof-of-Concept Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Nicotinamide in Early Alzheimer Disease.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nicotinamide is a coenzyme involved in cellular oxidation-reduction reactions that can inhibit Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) or sirtuins. HDAC inhibition can affect numerous therapeutic pathways, including tau phosphorylation. We tested the hypothesis that nicotinamide treatment could reduce tau phosphorylation in early Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2a proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 48 weeks of treatment with 1,500 mg of nicotinamide twice a day. The primary outcome was level of tau phosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-tau(231)) in CSF. Prespecified secondary outcomes were levels of p-tau(181), total tau, amyloid β40 (Aβ(40)), and Aβ(42) in CSF and the clinical measures Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog13), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale-Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-ADL-MCI), and Clinical Dementia Rating Summary of Boxes (CDR-SB). Participants were recruited at 2 academic clinical centers. Enrollment criteria included diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia with CSF biomarker confirmation of AD. The Holm-Bonferroni procedure was used to control type I error within biomarker and clinical domains. RESULTS: Of 47 participants enrolled (mean age = 73.8 years; 43% female), 1 dropped out before treatment initiation and 6 before completion, including 2 in the nicotinamide and 4 in the placebo arm. Adverse events (AEs) were balanced by arm, with few attributed to treatment. Common AEs included infections and nervous system disorders. There was no statistically significant benefit of nicotinamide on the primary outcome of week 48 change from baseline in CSF p-tau(231) (analysis of covariance; estimated mean difference in change between arms = -2.06, SE = 4.03; p = 0.61), with observed mean decline in CSF p-tau(231) greater in the nicotinamide arm (-4.7 ± 14.5) than in the placebo arm (-2.3 ± 10.6). No significant effects of treatment were observed on secondary biomarker outcomes (CSF p-tau(181), Aβ(40), Aβ(42), and total tau) in similar models (all p values >0.05), with observed mean changes in CSF p-tau(181) (0.4 ± 29.8 vs 10.4 ± 41.8) and total tau (8.4 ± 228.6 vs 60.5 ± 237.5) favoring nicotinamide compared with placebo. At week 48, nicotinamide-treated participants experienced less decline on CDR-SB (mixed-effect model with repeated measures; estimate = -1.42, SE = 0.65; p = 0.03 unadjusted for multiple comparisons), without significant differences in cognitive (ADAS-cog; estimate = -1.93, SE = 1.93; p = 0.32) or functional (ADCS-ADL-MCI; estimate = -3.10, SE = 1.86; p = 0.10) outcomes. DISCUSSION: Nicotinamide was safe but did not alter AD biomarkers. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with MCI or mild dementia with positive CSF AD biomarkers, 48 weeks of nicotinamide, 3,000 mg daily, is no better than placebo in reducing CSF p-tau(231).

39498901,Mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease eligibility for disease modification therapies in a tertiary centre for cognitive disorders: A simultaneous real-word study on aducanumab and lecanemab.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Food and Drug Administration approved two disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), aducanumab and lecanemab, with limited clinical impact but significant biomarker changes. Identifying suitable candidates for these DMTs outside randomized clinical trials (RCTs) remains uncertain. METHODS: This cross-sectional study, conducted in an Italian tertiary centre for cognitive disorders, aimed to evaluate how the RCT eligibility criteria for DMT treatments applies to participants with early AD. The broader Cummings et al. (Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, 2021, 2023) criteria and the clinical differences between DMT candidates were also assessed. RESULTS: The study involved 408 participants (mean age 71.1 ± 8.5 years, 48% male) with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (161/408, 39.5%) or mild dementia (247/408, 60.5%). Amongst them, 169 individuals (41%) showed positive AD pathology biomarkers. Eligibility RCT assessment revealed 14 patients eligible for aducanumab (3.43% of 408) and 28 for lecanemab (6.86% of 408). Following Cummings' real-world criteria, aducanumab eligibility increased to 9.56%, whereas lecanemab eligibility rose to 8.33%. Applying selection criteria to only the amyloid positive (169 out of 408), the selection for DMTs was 8.3% for aducanumab and 16.5% for lecanemab. CONCLUSION: Amongst subjects diagnosed with mild AD and mild cognitive impairment in a tertiary centre for cognitive disorders, only a small percentage of patients using RCT diagnostic criteria are eligible for DMT. The application of Cummings criteria strongly increased the DMT candidates. Nevertheless, the majority of patients with cognitive disorders have been excluded from DMTs approved so far.",European journal of neurology
39641407,Exerkines mitigating Alzheimer's disease progression by regulating inflammation: Focusing on macrophage/microglial NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.,"Recent research highlights the critical role of inflammation in accelerating amyloid beta and phosphorylated tubulin-associated protein tau cascade and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise influences AD by modulating inflammatory responses. We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple online databases. Our approach focused on previous and recent studies exploring the links among inflammation, AD, and the effects of exercise, specifically targeting research articles and books published in English. We pointed out that inflammation extends from the periphery to the central nervous system, facilitated by macrophage/microglial NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome signaling, which exacerbates classical AD mechanisms. Moreover, we provided further insights into the modulation of inflammasome signaling through exercise and exerkines, which may contribute to mitigating AD development. These insights deepen our understanding of AD mechanisms and offer the potential for identifying key therapeutic targets and biomarkers crucial for effective disease management and treatment. HIGHLIGHTS: Inflammation is potentially linked to the acceleration of classical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, including the pathways involving amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inflammation, initiated by the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway within M1-type macrophages/microglia, may contribute to neuroinflammation and AD progression. Exercise has the potential to reduce inflammation and the development of AD by influencing NLRP3 inflammasome signaling via exerkines.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39936291,The Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST): A plasma proteomic predictor of 20-year dementia risk.,"INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need for tools to quantify dementia risk during its multi-decade preclinical/prodromal phase, given that current biomarkers predict risk over shorter follow-up periods and are specific to Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Using high-throughput proteomic assays and machine learning techniques in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 11,277), we developed the Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST). RESULTS: In addition to outperforming existing plasma biomarkers, the dSST predicted mid-life dementia risk over a 20-year follow-up across two independent cohorts with different ethnic backgrounds (areas under the curve [AUCs]: dSST 0.68-0.70, dSST+age 0.75-0.81). In a separate cohort, the dSST was associated with longitudinal declines across multiple cognitive domains, accelerated brain atrophy, and elevated measures of neuropathology (as evidenced by positron emission tomography and plasma biomarkers). DISCUSSION: The dSST is a cost-effective, scalable, and minimally invasive protein-based prognostic aid that can quantify risk up to two decades before dementia onset. HIGHLIGHTS: The Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST) predicts 20-year dementia risk across two independent cohorts. dSST outperforms existing plasma biomarkers in predicting multi-decade dementia risk. dSST predicts cognitive decline and accelerated brain atrophy in a third cohort. dSST is a prognostic aid that can predict dementia risk over two decades.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39877979,Cross-cultural validation of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 as precision biomarkers for amyloid PET positivity: An East Asian study in Taiwan and Korea.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers have improved Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, but data from diverse Asian populations are limited. This study evaluated plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 levels in Korean and Taiwanese populations. METHODS: All participants (n = 270) underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and blood tests. Plasma p-tau model-derived probabilities of amyloid PET positivity (amyloid beta [Aβ]+) classified participants into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups. RESULTS: In both cohorts, plasma p-tau217 outperformed p-tau181, especially in cognitively unimpaired participants (area under the curve = 0.921 [p-tau217] vs. 0.769 [p-tau181], P(difference )= 0.022). Including apolipoprotein E status and glial fibrillary acidic protein improved model fit. The negative predictive value of the low-risk group and positive predictive value of the high-risk group were 97.5% and 86.0%, respectively. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 effectively predict Aβ+ among culturally different Asian populations. P-tau217 performed better, especially in the early stages of AD. Plasma p-tau217-based models reduced intermediate-risk classifications, suggesting fewer amyloid PET scans needed to confirm the diagnosis. HIGHLIGHTS: The efficacy of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and p-tau181 was analyzed in two Asian populations. Plasma p-tau217 performs better in predicting amyloid positron emission tomography positivity, especially in cognitively unimpaired subjects. Adding apolipoprotein E and glial fibrillary acidic protein to p-tau improved model accuracy. The models from each cohort were confirmed in the other cohort. Plasma p-tau-based risk stratification may reduce the need for confirmatory tests.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39935614,The Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) for biomarker categorization.,"Biomarkers are vital to Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development and clinical trials, and will have an increasing role in clinical care. In this narrative review, we demonstrate the use of the National Institutes on Aging/Alzheimer's Association (NIA/AA) Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) system for the categorization of biomarkers based on the primary mechanism on which they report. We show that biomarkers are available (in various levels of validation) for all CADRO processes. Application of the CADRO system demonstrates gaps in the field where novel biomarkers are needed for specific aspects of the disease, and assays to detect and measure biological changes, in individuals with symptomatic or preclinical AD. We demonstrate the CADRO system as a means of categorizing established and candidate AD biomarkers, showing the feasibility and practicality of the system. CADRO can assist with biomarker selection for AD clinical trials and drug development, and may eventually be applied to implementing biomarkers in patient care. HIGHLIGHTS: The Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) system can be used to categorize biomarkers for drug development.We demonstrate the use of CADRO with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.We identified AD biomarkers in each of the CADRO categories.CADRO can be incorporated into current AD drug development and clinical trial systems.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39749840,Retinal dysfunction in APOE4 knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is the predominant form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a strong genetic risk factor for LOAD. As an integral part of the central nervous system, the retina displays a variety of abnormalities in LOAD. Our study is focused on age-dependent retinal impairments in humanized APOE4-knock-in (KI) and APOE3-KI mice developed by the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (MODEL-AD) consortium. METHODS: All the experiments were performed on 52- to 57-week-old mice. The retina was assessed by optical coherence tomography, fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography, electroretinography, optomotor response, gliosis, and neuroinflammation. mRNA sequencing was performed to find molecular pathways. RESULTS: APOE4-KI mice showed impaired retinal structure, vasculature, function, vision, increased gliosis and neuroinflammation, and downregulation of synaptogenesis. DISCUSSION: The APOE ε4 allele is associated with increased susceptibility to retinal degeneration compared to the APOE ε3 allele. HIGHLIGHTS: Apolipoprotein E (APOE)4 mice exhibit structural and functional deficits of the retina. The retinal defects in APOE4 mice are attributed to increased neuroinflammation. APOE4 mice show a unique retinal transcriptome, yet with key brain similarities. The retina offers a non-invasive biomarker for the detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39401553,CSF and blood signatures support classification of limbic encephalitis subtypes.,"Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) represents a heterogeneous disease associated with antibodies targeting extracellular (ALE(extra)) epitopes, intracellular (ALE(intra)) epitopes, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase65 ALE (ALE(GAD65)), and ALE without detectable antibodies (ALE(abneg)). Combining analysis of cellular parameters, investigated by flow cytometry, and soluble parameters in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a large cohort of 148 ALE patients (33 ALE(extra), 12 ALE(intra), 28 ALE-GAD65, 37 ALE(abneg)) in comparison to paradigmatic examples for neuro-inflammatory (51 relapsing remitting MS patients (RRMS)), and neuro-degenerative (34 Alzheimer's disease patients (AD)) diseases revealed discrete immune signatures in ALE subgroups. Identification of ALE-subtype specific markers facilitated classification of rare ALE-associated tumors, which may prompt further diagnostic efforts in clinical practice. While ALE(intra) exhibited features of neuro-inflammation, ALE(extra) displayed features of neuro-inflammation as well as neuro-degeneration. Moreover, ALE(GAD65) and ALE(abneg) lacked hallmarks of inflammation. This may explain the low efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment regimens in ALE(GAD65) and presumably also ALE(abneg).","Brain, behavior, and immunity"
39998900,Tau pathology is associated with postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in early Alzheimer's disease in a sex-specific manner.,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the associations of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) with tau deposition and cognitive ability in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Twenty-six cognitively impaired (CI) and 14 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals underwent mGluR5 positron emission tomography (PET) ([(18)F]PSS232), amyloid PET ([(18)F]florbetapir), and tau PET ([(18)F]MK6240), and neuropsychological assessment. The relationships among mGluR5 availability, tau deposition, and neuropsychological assessment were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and mediation analyses. RESULTS: CI patients had lower mGluR5 in the hippocampus than CU (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr]: 2.03 ± 0.25 vs 1.79 ± 0.17, p = 0.003). Hippocampal mGluR5 was negatively associated with hippocampal tau deposition (r = -.46, p = 0.003) and positively associated with cognitive performance, but only in women. Hippocampal tau deposition mediated the effect of mGluR5 on cognitive performance. DISCUSSION: Reduced hippocampal mGluR5 is negatively related with tau deposition in most cortical regions and positively associated with cognitive performance, making it a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively impaired (CI) patients exhibited lower metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability in the hippocampus than cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was negatively associated with tau deposition in widespread cortex. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was positively associated with cognitive performance. The close association of mGluR5 with tau and cognition performance exists only in females.

We recently reported an AD-associated CD83(+) microglia subtype associated with increased immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in the transverse colon (TC). METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry (IHC), IgG4 repertoire profiling, and brain organoid experiments to explore this association. RESULTS: CD83(+) microglia in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) are associated with elevated IgG4 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the TC, anti-HCMV IgG4 in cerebrospinal fluid, and both HCMV and IgG4 in the SFG and vagal nerve. This association was replicated in an independent AD cohort. HCMV-infected cerebral organoids showed accelerated AD pathophysiological features (Aβ42 and pTau-212) and neuronal death. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate complex, cross-tissue interactions between HCMV and the adaptive immune response associated with CD83(+) microglia in persons with AD. This may indicate an opportunity for antiviral therapy in persons with AD and biomarker evidence of HCMV, IgG4, or CD83(+) microglia. HIGHLIGHTS: Cross-tissue interaction between HCMV and the adaptive immune response in a subset of persons with AD. Presence of CD83(+) microglial associated with IgG4 and HCMV in the gut.

39814528,Ethnic and racial influences on blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about confounding factors influencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood biomarker concentrations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to explore the available evidence for the influences of ethnicity and race on AD blood biomarker concentrations. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science databases spanning from inception until 15 June 2023. We included studies that utilized plasma or serum biomarkers (amyloid-β [Aβ], total tau [t-tau], phosphorylated tau [p-tau], neurofilament light [NfL], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), compared individuals with AD to healthy controls, and included a minimum of two ethnic or racial groups for comparison. A total of 10 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. All studies were conducted in the US. RESULTS: Seven studies reported differences in blood biomarker concentrations between ethnic or racial groups. However, after adjusting for medical conditions and social determinants of health, the differences became non-significant in two of the studies. The included studies differed in their included covariates and their statistical approaches, which complicated the interpretation of the observed differences. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that ethnicity and race may influence blood biomarker concentrations. However, it remains unclear to what extent these differences are mediated by differences in social determinants of health and medical conditions. Future studies are needed to explore ethnic and racial differences in blood biomarkers, including studies in diverse samples outside the US.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39617329,Serum metabolome profiling in patients with mild cognitive impairment reveals sex differences in lipid metabolism.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more women than men. Although women live longer than men, it is not longevity alone, but other factors, including metabolic changes, that contribute to the higher risk of AD in women. Metabolic pathways have been implicated in AD progression, but studies to date examined targeted pathways, leaving many metabolites unmeasured. Sex is often a neglected biological variable, and most metabolomic studies were not designed to investigate sex differences in metabolomic profiles. Here, we performed untargeted metabolomic profiling of sera from male and female patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common precursor to AD, and matched controls. We discovered significant metabolic changes in individuals with MCI, and found several pathways that were strongly associated with sex. Peptide energy metabolism demonstrated sexual dimorphism. Lipid pathways exhibited the strongest differences between female and male MCI patients, including specific phosphatidylcholine lipids, lysophospholipids, long-chain fatty acids, and monoacylglycerols. 1-palmitoleoyl glycerol and 1-arachidonoyl glycerol were higher in female MCI subjects than in male MCI subjects with no differences between control males and females. Conversely, specific dicarboxylic fatty acids were lower in female MCI subjects than male MCI subjects. In cultured astrocytes, 1-arachidonoyl glycerol promoted phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator sphingosine kinase 2, which was inhibited by the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor antagonists, as well as chromatin remodelling. Overall, we identified novel sex-specific metabolites in MCI patients that could serve as biomarkers of MCI in both sexes, help further define AD etiology, and reveal new potential prevention strategies for AD.",Neurobiology of disease
38753998,Oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress (OS) has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases in numerous epidemiological studies; however, whether it is a pathogenesis or a downstream factor remains controversial. METHODS: A two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was implemented to examine evidence of causality of 15 OS injury markers with 3 major neurodegenerative diseases using available genome-wide association studies statistics. As a main approach, inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis was performed. The weighted-median (WM) analysis was used to validate the relationship. In order to investigate the existence of horizontal pleiotropy and correct the IVW estimate, the Radial MR approach was applied. To gauge the consistency and robustness of the findings, several sensitivity and pleiotropy analyses were used. For this analysis, p < 0.05 indicates a nominally causal association; according to the Bonferroni correction test, p < 0.0011 indicates a statistically significant causal association. RESULTS: Via IVW and WM, in directional MR, it was genetically predicted that zinc was nominally causally correlated with the risk of Parkinson's disease but not after Bonferroni correction test; alpha-tocopherol was nominally causally correlated with the risk of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but not after Bonferroni correction test; furthermore, in reverse MR, it was genetically predicted that Alzheimer's disease was causally correlated with uric acid but not after Bonferroni correction test. These above findings were stable across sensitivity and pleiotropy analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current study, there is no authentic genetic causal association between OS biomarkers and neurodegenerative diseases. The complex relationship is required to be confirmed in future experimental research.",Nutritional neuroscience
39344050,A critical review of brexpiprazole oral tablets as the first drug approved to treat agitation symptoms associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Agitation is a common and disruptive syndrome in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brexpiprazole was recently approved for this agitation of AD dementia and is the only therapy approved for this indication. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and pharmacodynamics of brexpiprazole. Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studies of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in dementia due to AD are described. These studies demonstrated efficacy and safety for the 2 mg/d and 3 mg/d doses. Agitation reduction from baseline was significantly greater in the active treatment groups compared to the participants on placebo as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the primary outcome. Treatment benefit was demonstrated on the Clinician Global Impression - Severity, the key secondary outcome. Safety and tolerability were comparable in drug and placebo arms of the studies. EXPERT OPINION: Approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in dementia due to AD is an important milestone and regulatory precedent. This is the first approval for the treatment of any neuropsychiatric syndrome of AD. Brexpiprazole has a 'black box' warning for its use in psychosis caused by dementia due to an observed increase in mortality when using this class of antipsychotic agents in patients with dementia. Post-marketing surveillance will be key to understanding the safety profile of brexpiprazole. Brexpiprazole may be prioritized over the 'off label' use of other potential treatments for agitation.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics
39985973,The up-regulation of PTBP1 expression level in patients with Insomnia by senile dementia and promote cuproptosis of nerve cell by SLC31A1.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), often referred to as the modern-day scourge, stands as a significant health challenge characterized by high rates of disability and mortality, particularly among the geriatric population. Thus, the present study investigated the precise details of PTBP1 involvement in cuproptosis of nerve cell of patients with Insomnia by senile dementia (ISD). Patients with ISD, early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and Normal healthy volunteers were obtained. In the context of ISD, the elevated PTBP1 mRNA expressions were observed in patient samples, correlating positively with diminished cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and increased geriatric depression scale scores. The pivotal role of PTBP1 was further underscored by its inhibitory effects in a mice model, which prevented the development of senile dementia, and its influence on neuronal cell proliferation and ROS-induced oxidative stress in vitro. Additionally, PTBP1's regulatory capacity on the cuproptosis of nerve cells and its modulation of SLC31A1 expression, through effects on ubiquitination, were revealed. The stability of PTBP1, critical for its function, was enhanced by the m6A modification mediated by METTL3, highlighting a complex regulatory network in the pathogenesis of ISD. These data confirmed that PTBP1 plays a pivotal role in promoting the oxidative response and cuproptosis in Alzheimer's disease models via the SLC31A1 pathway. The findings suggest that PTBP1 could serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of ISD and AD, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this protein.",Sleep medicine

39588792,Elevated locus coeruleus metabolism provides resilience against cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alterations in locus coeruleus' (LC) metabolic turnover are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-pathology and cognitive impairment. However, the evolution of these changes across disease stages and their functional relevance remains unknown. METHODS: We examined associations of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) -derived LC metabolism with clinical diagnostic status, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -based AD biomarkers of AD pathology, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (n = 604). RESULTS: FDG-PET-derived LC metabolism was elevated in the earliest preclinical stages and lower in later disease stages. Higher LC metabolism was associated with attenuated memory decline in preclinical stages, particularly in those with low CSF Aβ(42,) but not in AD patients with cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: Higher locus coeruleus [(18)F]-FDG-PET-derived signal in the early preclinical stages of AD can confer cognitive resilience and may reflect increased metabolic activity, whereas later stages are characterized by lower LC FDG-PET-derived signal, possibly due to neurodegeneration. HIGHLIGHTS: LC FDG-PET signal is lower in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. LC FDG-PET signal is higher in the preclinical stage of AD. We observed less memory decline in those with higher LC FDG-PET signal. Higher LC FDG-PET signal conferred cognitive resilience in preclinical AD.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39885106,Prospective Investigation Unravels Plasma Proteomic Links to Dementia.,"Investigating plasma proteomic signatures of dementia offers insights into its pathology, aids biomarker discovery, supports disease monitoring, and informs drug development. Here, we analyzed data from 48,367 UK Biobank participants with proteomic profiling. Using Cox and generalized linear models, we examined the longitudinal associations between proteomic signatures and dementia-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization analysis was employed to identify causal associations, and machine learning algorithms were applied to develop protein-based models for dementia prediction. We identified 74 proteins significantly associated with the risk of various types of dementia and cognitive functions after Bonferroni correction. Among these, strong associations were observed for growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL), across all types of dementia. Additionally, 15 proteins demonstrated significant associations with neuroimaging-defined dementia endophenotypes. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses further substantiated causal relationships between dementia-associated proteins and Alzheimer's disease, particularly involving GDF15, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET), and GFAP. Moreover, we identified three protein modules associated with dementia, primarily linked to immune system processes, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism, providing insights into potential biological pathways underlying the disease. Furthermore, we proposed a ten-protein panel capable of forecasting dementia over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.837-0.876). Our results revealed dementia-associated plasma proteomic signatures, and their causal relationships, notably GDF15-RET signaling with Alzheimer's disease, and proposed a promising protein panel for high-risk dementia screening.",Molecular neurobiology
39639627,Plasma brain-derived tau correlates with cerebral infarct volume.,"BACKGROUND: A blood-based biomarker that accurately reflects neuronal injury in acute ischemic stroke could be an easily accessible and cost-effective complement to clinical and radiological evaluation. Here, we investigate whether plasma levels of the novel biomarker brain-derived tau (BD-tau) reflect cerebral infarct volumes and whether BD-tau can improve clinical outcome prediction. METHODS: The present study included 713 consecutive cases from two different hospital-based cohorts, the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) and SAHLSIS phase 2 (SAHLSIS2). Acute stroke severity was determined by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale converted to the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) in SAHLSIS and by the NIHSS in SAHLSIS2. All participants were assessed for functional outcome 3 months after stroke by the modified Rankin Scale, and 254 participants in SAHLSIS had quantitative neuroimaging available. FINDINGS: Plasma BD-tau concentrations and cerebral infarct volumes were highly correlated (ρ 0.72, p < 0.001). BD-tau improved the prognostic accuracy of suffering an unfavorable outcome over age and stroke severity in the whole cohort. However, the gain in predictive power was dependent on stroke severity and infarct location. The largest improvement was observed for mild ischemic strokes (NIHSS <5; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73 for age + NIHSS versus AUC = 0.84 with addition of BD-tau; DeLong p 0.02), posterior circulation stroke (AUC = 0.75 vs. AUC = 0.84; DeLong p 0.06) and more specifically for infarcts in the brainstem/cerebellum (AUC = 0.74 vs. 0.87; DeLong p 0.009). CONCLUSION: Plasma BD-tau can provide information on the extent of acute neuronal damage in ischemic stroke and adds prognostic value for outcome, especially for mild and posterior circulation strokes.",Journal of internal medicine
39988572,Retinal vascular alterations in cognitive impairment: A multicenter study in China.,"INTRODUCTION: Foundational models suggest Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be diagnosed using retinal images, but the specific structural features remain poorly understood. This study investigates retinal vascular changes in individuals with cognitive impairment in three East Asian regions. METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Ningxia, collecting retinal images from 176 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and 264 controls. The VC-Net deep learning model segmented arterial/venous networks, extracting 36 vascular features. RESULTS: Significant reductions in vessel length, segment number, and vascular density were observed in cognitively impaired patients, while venous structure and complexity were correlated with the level of cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Retinal vascular changes may serve as indicators of cognitive impairment, requiring validation in larger cohorts and exploration of the underlying mechanisms. HIGHLIGHTS: A deep learning segmentation model extracted diverse retinal vascular features. Significant alterations in the structure of retinal arterial/venous networks were identified. Partitioning vessel-rich retinal zones improved detection of vascular changes. Decreases in vessel length, segment number, and vascular density were found in CI individuals.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39798799,Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity As a Transdiagnostic Biomarker of Cognitive Function.,"The default mode network (DMN) is intricately linked with processes such as self-referential thinking, episodic memory recall, goal-directed cognition, self-projection, and theory of mind. In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of studies examining its functional connectivity, particularly its relationship with frontoparietal networks involved in top-down attention, executive function, and cognitive control. The fluidity in switching between these internal and external modes of processing, which is highlighted by anticorrelated functional connectivity, has been proposed as an indicator of cognitive health. Due to the ease of estimation of functional connectivity-based measures through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms, there is now a wealth of large-scale datasets, paving the way for standardized connectivity benchmarks. In this review, we explore the promising role of DMN connectivity metrics as potential biomarkers of cognitive state across attention, internal mentation, mind wandering, and meditation states and investigate deviations in trait-level measures across aging and in clinical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and others. We also tackle the issue of reliability of network estimation and functional connectivity and share recommendations for using functional connectivity measures as a biomarker of cognitive health.",Biological psychiatry.

40071061,Opportunities to encourage adoption of a biomarker-enabled care pathway for Alzheimer's in primary care.,"Identification of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a challenge due to limited specialist availability, diagnostic access, disease awareness, and cultural factors. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) could play a critical role in the identification and referral of patients suspected of AD to specialty care. A multidisciplinary AD Biomarker Task Force was convened to evaluate current biomarker use cases, define an optimal biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway, and understand factors impacting adoption. The Task Force identified opportunities to support biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway adoption, including streamlining risk assessment and screening by leveraging digital tools, activating primary care providers through education, generating data to expand applicability to diverse populations, and advocating for aligned policies and quality measures. Adoption of BBBMs in the primary care setting will be critical to improve early AD detection. However, challenges to pathway adoption persist and will require action from clinicians, payers, policy makers, and patients to address. HIGHLIGHTS: Blood-based biomarkers can streamline the identification of AD in primary care.Future biomarker-enabled diagnostic care pathways will leverage digital assessments.Education, data generation, and policy advocacy are vital to encourage BBBM use.Implementation of AD care pathways requires the activation of diverse stakeholders.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39614747,ADNI Biomarker Core: A review of progress since 2004 and future challenges.,"BACKGROUND: We describe the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Biomarker Core major activities from October 2004 to March 2024, including biobanking ADNI cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and serum biofluid samples, biofluid analyses for Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the Biomarker Core and various non-ADNI laboratories, and continuous assessments of pre-analytics. RESULTS: Validated immunoassay and mass spectrometry-based assays were performed in CSF with a shift to plasma, a more accessible biofluid, as qualified assays became available. Performance comparisons across different CSF and plasma AD biomarker measurement platforms have enriched substantially the ADNI participant database enabling method performance determinations for AD pathology detection and longitudinal assessments of disease progression. DISCUSSION: Close collaboration with academic and industrial partners in the validation and implementation of AD biomarkers for early detection of disease pathology in treatment trials and ultimately in clinical practice is a key factor for the success of the work done in the Biomarker Core. HIGHLIGHTS: Describe ADNI Biomarker Core biobanking and sample distribution from 2007 to 2024. Discuss validated mass spectrometry and immunoassay methods for ADNI biofluid analyses.

39874644,"Brain microenvironment-remodeling nanomedicine improves cerebral glucose metabolism, mitochondrial activity and synaptic function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","The development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease remains challenging due to the complex pathology and the presence of the blood-brain barrier. Previously we have described the investigation of a brain-penetrating multifunctional bioreactive nanoparticle system capable of remodeling the hypoxic and inflammatory brain microenvironment and reducing beta-amyloid plaques improving cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the linkage of hypoxia and inflammation to metabolic alteration, the effects of this system on modulating cerebral glucose metabolism, mitochondrial activity and synaptic function remained to be elucidated. To examine this, a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (TgCRND8) in vivo were treated intravenously with beta-amyloid antibody-conjugated (Ab), blood-brain barrier-crossing terpolymer (TP) containing polymer-lipid based manganese dioxide nanoparticles (Ab-TP-MDNPs). Alterations in cerebral glucose utilization were determined by [(1)⁸F]FDG-PET imaging in vivo, with glucose metabolism and mitochondrial activity analyzed by biomarkers and studies with primary neurons in vitro. Synaptic function was evaluated by both biomarkers and electrophysiologic analysis. Current study shows that intravenously administered Ab-TP-MDNPs enhanced cerebral glucose utilization, improved glucose metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and increased the levels of neprilysin, O-glycosylation. The consequence of this was enhanced glucose and ATP availability, resulting in improved long-term potentiation for promoting neuronal synaptic function. This study highlights the importance of targeting the metabolism of complex disease pathologies in addressing disease-modifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.",Biomaterials
39935329,SSRIs reduce plasma tau and restore dorsal raphe metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Tau pathology impacts neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) being among the brain regions showing the earliest tau pathology. As a serotonergic hub, DRN activity is altered by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which also have variable effects on cognitive decline and pathology in AD. METHODS: We examined N = 191 subjects with baseline (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and plasma biomarker data to study the effects of SSRIs on tau pathology, cognitive decline, and DRN metabolism. RESULTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) was lower with SSRI use. The effect of SSRIs on cognition varied by cognitive assessment. The DRN was hypometabolic in AD patients relative to healthy controls; however, SSRI use restored the metabolic activity of this region in AD patients. DISCUSSION: Long-term SSRI use may reduce the pathological presentation of AD but has variable effects on cognitive performance. HIGHLIGHTS: Tau pathology spreads throughout the brain during AD pathogenesis. The DRN is among the first regions to develop tau pathology during this process. SSRI use restores the metabolic activity of the DRN and reduces plasma p-tau181.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39443362,Unveiling the hippocampal subfield changes across the Alzheimer's disease continuum: a systematic review of neuroimaging studies.,"Studies exploring the hippocampal subfield atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown contradictory results. This review aims to disentangle such heterogeneity by investigating the dynamic changes of hippocampal subfields across the AD continuum. We systematically searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for case-control studies. Selected studies included investigations of biomarker-based amyloid status and reported data on hippocampal subfield atrophy using advanced MRI techniques. Twelve studies were included. Despite high heterogeneity, a distinguishable pattern of vulnerability of hippocampal subfields can be recognized from the cognitively unimpaired phase to the dementia stage, shedding light on hippocampal changes with disease progression. Consistent findings revealed atrophy in the subiculum and presubiculum, along with a potential increase in volume in the cornu ammonis (CA) among the cognitively unimpaired group, a feature not observed in patients experiencing subjective cognitive decline. Atrophy in the subiculum, presubiculum, CA 1-4, and the dentate gyrus characterized the mild cognitive impairment stage, with a more pronounced severity in the progression to dementia.",Brain imaging and behavior
39855320,Decreased serum PF4 levels correlate with cognitive decline and CSF biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a chemotactic factor secreted from the α-granules of platelets, has recently been proved to mitigate neuroinflammation and improve aging-related cognition decline, which may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the alterations of serum PF4 levels in AD, the correlation between serum PF4 and β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the potential diagnostic utility of PF4 in AD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 38 amyloid-positive AD patients and 50 cognitively normal controls. The levels of serum PF4 were detected using the Human CXCL4/PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit. The levels of CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, and t-tau were measured on the fully-automated Lumipulse G1200 platform via commercially available kits. RESULTS: The levels of serum PF4 were significantly decreased in AD patients (5163.51 (3198.24-6301.15) vs. 5859.29 (4126.06-8006.70), Z = -2.30, P = 0.021). The negative correlation between AD diagnosis (β = -1972.292, P = 0.009) and PF4 levels retained after the adjustments of age, sex, APOE ε4 status, platelet count, platelet distribution width (PDW), and comorbidity of dyslipidemia in the multiple linear regression analysis. Further analysis showed that serum PF4 levels were positively correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and negatively correlated with CSF t-tau levels. Besides, the area under the curve (AUC) of serum PF4 for AD (AUC = 0.6437, P = 0.022) was comparable to that of CSF Aβ40 (AUC = 0.6400) yet lower than those of CSF Aβ42, ptau181, and t-tau. The AUC slightly increased when combining serum PF4 with other CSF AD biomarkers separately. CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of PF4 were decreased in AD patients and were significantly correlated with the cognitive function and CSF levels of Aβ42 and t-tau. PF4 may become a promising anti-aging and therapeutic target for AD, which is worthy of further study.",Experimental gerontology
39775480,Importance of Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Circadian Disruption-Associated Biomarkers in Emergence of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major devastating neurodegenerative disorder afflicting majorly the geriatric population. Emerging studies augur the connection of gut dysbiosis and circadian disruption with the early onset of AD. Gut dysbiosis is characterized by dysregulated gut microbiota signature and compromised intestinal integrity, which provokes the translocation of bacterial metabolites into the systemic circulation. Noteworthy, gut-derived metabolites like calprotectin, trimethylamine-N-oxide, kynurenine, isoamylamine, and short-chain fatty acids play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Circadian dysregulation also corresponds with the exacerbated AD pathogenesis by accumulating Aβ and tau proteins. Moreover, circadian dysregulation is one of the causative factors for gut dysbiosis. This review discusses the complex interplay between the microbiota-gut-brain axis, circadian rhythmicity, and the emergence of AD. We reviewed preclinical and clinical studies on AD describing potential biomarkers of gut dysbiosis and circadian dysregulation. The identification of new biomarkers associated with the microbiota-gut-brain axis and circadian rhythmicity may help in early diagnosis and development of targeted therapies for mitigating neurodegenerative AD.",Molecular neurobiology
40015298,"Associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, p-tau181, and cognition in healthy older adults with memory complaints: a secondary analysis from the MAPT.","BACKGROUND: Physical activity provides benefits against cognitive decline but its associations with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology are not fully understood. We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and phosphorylated (p)-tau181 blood concentrations, and the role of p-tau181 in the associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition. METHODS: In this post-hoc secondary analysis, we used data from a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial (the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial [MAPT]), in which adults aged 70 years and older were recruited from the community in 13 memory centres in France and Monaco. Individuals were eligible if they met at least one of the following criteria: spontaneous memory complaints, low gait speed (≤0·77 m/s), or limitation in at least one instrumental activity of daily living. Exclusion criteria included a dementia diagnosis, a Mini Mental State Examination score below 24, and having limitations in basic activities of daily living. For this secondary analysis, participants from MAPT were included if they had blood p-tau181 concentrations measured at baseline or at 3 years, or both timepoints. Self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (in metabolic equivalent of task min per week) and a cognitive composite score (calculated by averaging the Z scores of four cognitive tests) were assessed at baseline and at 6 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years. Mixed-effect models were used to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and p-tau181 concentrations and to explore the mediating and moderating role of p-tau181 concentration on the association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition. FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2008, and Feb 24, 2011, 1679 individuals were enrolled in the MAPT, of whom 558 adults had measurements of p-tau181 concentrations at baseline, 3 years, or both timepoints. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were associated with slower changes in p-tau181 concentrations over time. Compared with inactive individuals, those with low levels of activity (low moderate-to-vigorous physical activity × time: B = -0·109 [95% CI -0·206 to -0·012; p=0·028]) or high levels of activity (high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity × time: B=-0·114 [95% CI -0·208 to -0·020; p=0·018) had a slower increase in p-tau181 concentrations. We did not identify any association between baseline p-tau181 concentrations and baseline moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition were attenuated with increasing baseline p-tau181 concentrations. Specifically, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was no longer favourably associated with the cognitive composite score when baseline p-tau181 concentration exceeded 9·36 pg/mL and 3·5 pg/mL for the cross-sectional association and longitudinal association, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that engaging in more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity might help to slow the age-related neurodegenerative process, although p-tau pathophysiology seems to mitigate the beneficial associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition in older adults. Verification of these findings in larger population samples will be needed. FUNDING: Toulouse Gérontopôle, French Ministry of Health, and Pierre Fabre Research Institute.",The lancet.

39991795,Cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations: A digital phenotype of neurodegeneration.,"INTRODUCTION: Cognition is reduced at low and high glucose, reflecting cognitive vulnerability to glucose (CVG) fluctuations. The impact of glucose fluctuations on the aging brain remains unclear. We examined whether CVG is associated with plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration. METHODS: Participants included N = 114 adults with type 1 diabetes assessed for processing speed and sustained attention using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We characterized associations between CVG and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. RESULTS: CVG was associated with all plasma biomarkers, except Aβ 42/40. CVG for sustained attention exhibited strong associations with p-tau biomarkers that persisted across covariate specifications. DISCUSSION: CVG may be a useful digital phenotype of AD. It remains unclear whether CVG contributes to versus arises from neurodegeneration. We consider possible mechanisms linking cognitive vulnerability and long-term glucose variability to the development of neuropathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive vulnerability to glucose (CVG) may be a useful digital phenotype of neurodegeneration. We used cognitive ecological momentary assessment and continuous glucose monitoring to investigate CVG's associations with plasma biomarkers. Associations of CVG for sustained attention and phosphorylated tau 181 remained significant across covariates.

39588767,The Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI).,"The presence of multiple pathologies is the largest predictor of dementia. A major gap in the field is the in vivo detection of mixed pathologies and their antecedents. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to address this gap. The ADRCs longitudinally follow ≈ 17,000 participants, ranging from cognitively unimpaired to dementia, arising from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD; e.g., AD, Lewy body disorders, vascular). Motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative's (ADNI) impact, the ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI) was formed. Leveraging existing ADRC infrastructure, CLARiTI will integrate standardized imaging and plasma collection to characterize mixed pathologies and use community-engaged research methods to ensure that ≥ 25% of the sample is from underrepresented populations (e.g., ethnoculturally minoritized, low education). The resulting ADRD profiles, within a more diverse sample, will provide key resources for ADRCs and an unprecedented, more generalizable publicly available imaging-plasma dataset.

39881147,Increased plasma DOPA decarboxylase levels in Lewy body disorders are driven by dopaminergic treatment.,"DOPA Decarboxylase (DDC) has been proposed as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker with increased concentrations in Lewy body disorders (LBDs) and highest levels in patients receiving dopaminergic treatment. Here we evaluate plasma DDC, measured by proximity extension assay, and the effect of dopaminergic treatment in three independent LBD (with a focus on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD)) cohorts: an autopsy-confirmed cohort (n = 71), a large multicenter, cross-dementia cohort (n = 1498) and a longitudinal cohort with detailed treatment information (n = 66, median follow-up time[IQR] = 4[4, 4] years). Plasma DDC was not altered between different LBDs and other disease groups or controls in absence of treatment. DDC levels increased over time in PD, being significantly associated to higher dosages of dopaminergic treatment. This emphasizes the need to consider treatment effect when analyzing plasma DDC, and suggests that plasma DDC, in contrast to CSF DDC, is of limited use as a diagnostic biomarker for LBD, but could be valuable for treatment monitoring.",Nature communications
39704304,Biological brain age and resilience in cognitively unimpaired 70-year-old individuals.,"INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the associations of brain age gap (BAG)-a biological marker of brain resilience-with life exposures, neuroimaging measures, biological processes, and cognitive function. METHODS: We derived BAG by subtracting predicted brain age from chronological age in 739 septuagenarians without dementia or neurological disorders. Robust linear regression models assessed BAG associations with life exposures, plasma inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration and vascular brain injury, and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Greater BAG (older-looking brains) was associated with physical inactivity, diabetes, and stroke, while prediabetes was related to lower BAG, that is, younger-looking brains. Physical activity mitigated the link between obesity and BAG. Greater BAG was associated with greater small vessel disease burden, white-matter alterations, inflammation, high glucose, poorer vascular-related cognitive domains. Sex-specific associations were identified. DISCUSSION: Vascular-related lifestyles and health shape brain appearance. Inflammation and insulin-related processes may be keys to understanding vascular cognitive disorders. HIGHLIGHTS: BAG, reflecting deviations from CA, can indicate resilience. Diabetes, stroke, and low physical activity link to ""older"" brains (greater BAG). Physical activity yielded to ""younger"" brains in septuagenarians with obesity. High cerebrovascular burden, inflammation, and glucose associate with ""older"" brains.

39894921,MicroRNA-based recent research developments in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory and physical impairment in aged individuals. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded noncoding RNAs that induce translational repression by binding to the 3' UTR of a target mRNA. miRNAs play a crucial role in neurological activity by mediating cellular proliferation, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis and more. Ongoing research in patents and clinical trials have called attention to promising miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutics in AD. Recent research has shown that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD brain, blood, cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Attenuated miRNA expressions have diagnostic potential in AD by interacting with amyloid-β synthesis, phosphorylated tau, and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, miRNA-29a, miRNA-125b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a, and miRNA-155 have shown promise as potential biomarker candidates for AD. Improving cognitive symptoms can be traced to restoring the endogenous miRNA activity by synthesizing miRNA mimics and miRNA antisense oligonucleotides. miRNA-483-5p, miRNA-188-5p, miRNA-219, miRNA135a/5p, miRNA-23/23b-3p, miRNA-124, and miRNA-455-3p are growing therapeutics for AD. However, miRNA-based therapeutics struggle outside of preclinical testing. miRNA-107, miRNA-206, miRNA-30/7, and miRNA-142-3p face bottlenecks in clinical trials due to a lack of experimental design, transparency and volunteer size. Patenting recent miRNA-based developments demonstrates the commitment in identifying a new biomarker and/or therapeutic for AD.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39880323,The inflammatory profiling in a cohort of older patients suffering from cognitive decline and dementia.,"BACKGROUND: During aging, there is a progressive impairment of immune cell function that triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines causing the so-called ""inflammaging"". Frailty represents a condition of increased vulnerability to stresses and reduced homeostatic reserve reflecting not only health status but also biological age. In older subjects without dementia, we showed that markers of inflammaging were differently associated with chronological age than with frailty. This study analysed the same markers in older people with cognitive decline and/or dementia. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 776 community-dwelling older people: 235 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 63 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 175 with mixed dementia (MD), and 303 subjects without cognitive decline. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and peripheral markers of neuroinflammation were analysed by next-generation ELISA. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, frailty, education and Apolipoprotein E genotype, only interleukin-10, interleukin-1β, and neurofilament light chain were associated with the risk for AD and MD. Moreover, interleukin-6 showed a weak association only with AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed similar associations between AD and MD, supporting the concept that late-onset dementia is a complex outcome of aging, intimately linked to the individual's health status as well as frailty.",Experimental gerontology
40510352,Single-cell transcriptomics for immune profiling of cerebrospinal fluid in neurological diseases.,"In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, setting the stage for future breakthroughs.",Frontiers in immunology
39085534,No association between markers of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction with Alzheimer's disease progression: a longitudinal study.,"INTRODUCTION: Systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are potentially modifiable factors implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which offer potential therapeutic targets to slow disease progression. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between baseline circulating levels of inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1ß) and endothelial cell markers (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin) and 18-month cognitive decline (ADAS-cog12) in 266 mild-to-moderate AD patients from the NILVAD study. We employed individual growth models to examine associations, potential mediation, and interaction effects while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: The average increase in ADAS-cog12 scores over all patients was 8.1 points in 18 months. No significant association was found between the markers and the rate of cognitive decline. Mediation analysis revealed no mediating role for endothelial cell markers, and interaction effects were not observed. DISCUSSION: Our results do not support the role of systemic inflammation or endothelial dysfunction in progression in persons with AD.",GeroScience
37898567,Agreement of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and amyloid-PET in a multicenter study.,"Core Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have shown incomplete agreement with amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET). Our goal was to analyze the agreement between AD CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET in a multicenter study. Retrospective multicenter study (5 centers). Participants who underwent both CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET scan within 18 months were included. Clinical diagnoses were made according to latest diagnostic criteria by the attending clinicians. CSF Amyloid Beta(1-42) (Aβ(1-42), A), phosphorliated tau 181 (pTau181, T) and total tau (tTau, N) biomarkers were considered normal (-) or abnormal ( +) according to cutoffs of each center. Amyloid-PET was visually classified as positive/negative. Agreement between CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET was analyzed by overall percent agreement (OPA). 236 participants were included (mean age 67.9 years (SD 9.1), MMSE score 24.5 (SD 4.1)). Diagnoses were mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD (49%), Lewy body dementia (22%), frontotemporal dementia (10%) and others (19%). Mean time between tests was 5.1 months (SD 4.1). OPA between single CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET was 74% for (Aβ1-42), 75% for pTau181, 73% for tTau. The use of biomarker ratios improved OPA: 87% for Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40) (n = 155), 88% for pTau181/Aβ(1-42) (n = 94) and 82% for tTau/Aβ(1-42) (n = 160). A + T + N + cases showed the highest agreement between CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET (96%), followed by A-T-N- cases (89%). Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40) was a better marker of cerebral amyloid deposition, as identified by amyloid tracers, than Aβ(1-42) alone. Combined biomarkers in CSF predicted amyloid-PET result better than single biomarkers.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience
39697158,Defining benefit: Clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway.,"To understand the potential benefits of emerging Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies within and beyond clinical trial settings, there is a need to advance current outcome measurements into meaningful information relevant to all stakeholders. The relationship between the impact on disease biology and clinically measurable outcomes in cognition, function, and behavior must be considered when defining the meaningful benefit of early AD therapies. In this review, we discuss: (1) the lack of consideration for biomarkers in the current concept of meaningfulness in AD; (2) the lack of gold standards for determining minimal biologically and clinically important differences (MBCIDs) in AD trials; (3) how the treatment benefits of disease-modifying treatments are cumulative and increase over time; and (4) the different concepts of meaningfulness among key stakeholders. This review utilizes the future clinical biological framework of AD and aims to further integrate and expand the parameters of meaningful benefits toward a precision medicine framework. HIGHLIGHTS: Definition of meaningful benefit from Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment varies across disease stage and stakeholder perspectives. Observable and meaningful outcomes must consider the clinical-biological nature of AD. Statistically significant effects or outcomes do not always equate to clinically meaningfulness. Assessment tools must reflect stage-specific subtle changes following treatment. Real-world evidence will support consensus, definition, and interpretation of clinical meaningfulness.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39718338,Precision diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease for therapeutic interventions.,"With the advent of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) therapy, precision diagnosis is necessary for identifying appropriate patients with cognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease. Therapy with AAMAs requires that candidates be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β, have good physical, psychiatric, and medical health, and lack clinical or biomarker evidence of potentially impactful non-Alzheimer brain disorders. The first three diagnostic activities are the core of the Clinical Practice Guidelines, but the last element of the precision diagnosis requires new decision-making tools for recognizing multi-etiology cognitive impairment. Within the context of shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and family, proper diagnosis is essential. In addition to discussing the benefits and risks of AAMA therapy, the experienced clinician must empathetically assist in bridging the gap between expectations of benefit and the patient's overall diagnostic suitability for AAMA therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: In order to prescribe an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) to the right patients, those selected for treatment should be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β (Aβ), and have good physical, psychiatric, or medical health. Persons with Alzheimer's biology as the primary etiology are the ideal AAMA treatment recipients. A novel activity necessary to optimize therapeutic response is to exclude persons with clinical or biomarker evidence of alternative contributory brain disorders. While mild clinical severity and elevated brain amyloid-β are essential elements for selecting patients for AAMA treatment, clinical judgment is required to weigh the implications of more advanced disease severity, other medical co-morbidities, and the presence of other contributory neuropathologies.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39894694,"Atypical Alzheimer's dementia: Addressing the subtypes, epidemiology, atypical presentations, diagnostic biomarkers, and treatment updates.","Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population; and is characterized by the gradual loss of memory, cognition, and ability to carry out daily activities. However, a growing body of research indicates that there exists a subtype of Alzheimer's disease known as Atypical Alzheimer's disease. Atypical Alzheimer's disease is a rare form of dementia that differs from the typical presentation of Alzheimer's disease, such as variations in the age of onset, distribution of brain pathology, and clinical symptoms. The patients affected have a younger age of onset and have predominantly visual, language, executive function, motor, and behavioral dysfunction. The diagnosis requires a comprehensive neurological evaluation with specific attention to cognitive and behavioral changes while ruling out other potential causes of dementia. Emerging biomarkers including CSF profiles, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and advanced neuroimaging techniques offer promising avenues for improving diagnostic accuracy and understanding disease mechanisms. In this article, we focus on atypical presentations seen in the posterior cortical variant, frontal variant, progressive aphasic variant, corticobasal syndrome and look at the specific biomarkers used in the diagnosis of each variant along with focusing on the treatment of the disease. We also aim to provide an understanding of Atypical Alzheimer's disease, its clinical features, the biomarkers helping in diagnosing the disease, the current treatment guidelines, and the current scientific advancements in the field.",Disease-a-month : DM
40023055,Event-related potential markers of subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment during a sustained visuo-attentive task.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease stages lack well-defined electrophysiological correlates, creating a critical gap in the identification of robust biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. In this study, we analysed event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a sustained visual attention task in a cohort of 178 individuals (119 SCD, 40 MCI, and 19 healthy subjects, HS) to investigate sensory and cognitive processing alterations associated with these conditions. SCD patients exhibited significant attenuation in both sensory (P1, N1, P2) and cognitive (P300, P600, P900) components compared to HS, with cognitive components showing performance-related gains. In contrast, MCI patients did not show a further decrease in any ERP component compared to SCD. Instead, they exhibited compensatory enhancements, reversing the downward trend observed in SCD. This compensation resulted in a non-monotonic pattern of ERP alterations across clinical conditions, suggesting that MCI patients engage neural mechanisms to counterbalance sensory and cognitive deficits. These findings support the use of electrophysiological markers in support of medical decision-making, enhancing personalized prognosis and guiding targeted interventions in cognitive decline.",NeuroImage.

39754256,Targeting uric acid: a promising intervention against oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are recognized as key factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet effective interventions and biomarkers to address oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in these conditions are limited. Uric acid (UA), traditionally associated with gout, is now gaining prominence as a potential target in neurodegenerative diseases. Soluble UA stands out as one of the most vital antioxidant compounds produced by the human body, accounting for up to 55% of the extracellular capacity to neutralize free radicals. While there is increasing evidence supporting the neuroprotective properties of UA in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, gaps in knowledge still exist regarding the underlying mechanisms and how to effectively translate these benefits into clinical practice. Moreover, the current UA elevation therapy exhibits unstable antioxidant properties, individual variability, and even adverse effects, limiting its potential clinical applications. This review consolidates recent advancements in understanding how UA exerts neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases and emphasizes the dual roles of UA in managing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Additionally, the review elucidates the mechanisms through which UA confers neuroprotection. Based on this, the review underscores the significance of UA as a potential biomarker and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of its potential as a therapeutic target, while also addressing possible challenges to clinical implementation.",Cell communication and signaling : CCS
39898436,Soluble Aβ pathology predicts neurodegeneration and cognitive decline independently on p-tau in the earliest Alzheimer's continuum: Evidence across two independent cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Identifying the link between early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological changes and neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals may lead to the discovery of preventive strategies. We assessed longitudinal brain atrophy and cognitive decline as a function of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in two independent cohorts of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. METHODS: We used longitudinal voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in combination with hippocampal subfield segmentation. Changes in neuroimaging and cognitive variables were inspected using general linear models (GLMs) adjusting by age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) status, follow-up time, and years of education. RESULTS: In both cohorts, baseline CSF amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers significantly predicted medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy rates and episodic memory (EM) decline independently of CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau). DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that soluble Aβ dyshomeostasis triggers MTL longitudinal atrophy and EM decline independently of CSF p-tau. Our data underscore the need for secondary preventive strategies at the earliest stages of the AD pathological cascade. HIGHLIGHTS: We assessed brain atrophy and cognitive decline in asymptomatic individuals. Aβ biomarkers predicted MTL atrophy independently of p-tau. Our results underscore the importance of undertaking Alzheimer's preclinical trials.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39546224,"Personality, Aging, and Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Psychoneuroimmunology and Personalized Medicine.","Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) advancements may revolutionize personalized medicine by identifying systemic biomarkers that enhance diagnosis and treatment. Inflammatory pathways connect personality traits with cognitive performance, aging-related disorders, and mortality risks. Studies have demonstrated the critical interactions between personality and various biological systems like the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The gut-brain axis also affects behaviors and psychological states in older adults, with specific gut microbiota influencing cognition, mood, and personality. These findings underscore the practical implications of understanding personality-biology interactions. They can support preventive and personalized medicine for aging-associated disorders. Specifically, personality changes are prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, impacting clinical management and caregiver stress. Non-cognitive factors, such as personality traits and psychiatric symptoms, may serve as early markers of AD. Traits like high Neuroticism and low Openness can predict initial AD stages, often before a formal diagnosis. Personality alterations in AD are also linked to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and vascular imaging biomarkers, which can track AD pathology and serve as predictors. Dynamic personality assessment can aid in timely diagnosis, monitoring progression, and evaluating treatments of AD. Understanding personality traits is crucial for predicting burnout, lifespan, and intervention success. Integrating personality and PNI biomarkers into patient profiles will support the development of personalized and systems medicine.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)"
39907306,Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 as a Discriminative Biomarker for Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers may offer a non-invasive approach to diagnose cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), especially in early-stage. We evaluated the ability of plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau 217) to differentiate CAA from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and deep perforator arteriopathy (DPA). METHODS: Patients with AD (age 73.7 ± 8.1 years), probable CAA (74.8 ± 6.9 years), or DPA (66.1 ± 10.4 years) were enrolled from memory and stroke clinics at a medical center in Taiwan. All participants received amyloid and tau PET scans. Plasma biomarkers were measured via a SIMOA immunoassay platform. The diagnostic utility of p-tau 217 was assessed using ROC analyses and the Youden cutoff. Associations between plasma p-tau 217 and neuroimaging variables in CAA were explored. RESULTS: Patients with CAA had lower plasma p-tau 217 (0.69 ± 0.76 vs. 1.28 ± 0.97 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and a lower p-tau 217/Aβ40 ratio (0.003 ± 0.002 vs. 0.006 ± 0.003, p < 0.001) than the AD group but higher levels than the DPA group (p-tau 217, 0.27 ± 0.13 pg/mL, p = 0.001; p-tau 217/Aβ40, 0.001 ± 0.0005, p < 0.001), although adjustment attenuated the difference in p-tau 217 between CAA and DPA. Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ40/Aβ42 were not significantly different between groups. Plasma p-tau 217 had moderate to good diagnostic utility to differentiate CAA vs. AD (sensitivity, 64.4%; specificity, 89.5%; AUC, 0.809) and CAA vs. DPA (sensitivity, 67.8%; specificity, 100%; AUC, 0.855). In CAA, p-tau 217 significantly correlated with the severity of CAA, amyloid PET signal intensity, and lobar microbleed count (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma p-tau 217 may represent a non-invasive biomarker for distinguishing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) from other conditions, including AD and DPA.",European journal of neurology
39535359,The mediating role of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein in amyloid and tau pathology in Down's syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in Down's syndrome (DS) occurs within a compressed timeline compared to sporadic or other genetic forms of AD. METHODS: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and plasma pTau-217 levels were compared by AD pathophysiology (amyloid (A+) and tau (T+) positron emission tomography [PET]) in persons with DS (N = 348) and sibling controls (N = 42). Plasma GFAP, plasma pTau-217, amyloid-PET, and tau-PET levels were compared with regard to estimated years to onset of clinical symptoms (52.5 years old). We evaluated if plasma GFAP mediated the relationship between amyloid PET and plasma pTau-217 or tau PET. RESULTS: Plasma GFAP, a measure of astrogliosis, was elevated in A+/T- and A+/T+ individuals with DS. Plasma pTau-217 was elevated in A+/T+ individuals with DS. GFAP partially mediated the relationship between amyloid-PET and tau-PET (15.3%) and amyloid-PET and plasma pTau-217 (42.1%). DISCUSSION: Astrogliosis is a key component in the advancement of preclinical AD pathophysiology in DS. HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid may be a necessary precursor for stimulating astrocytes. Astrogliosis may play a key role in modifications to tau phosphorylation. Targeting neuroinflammation may only aid amyloid positive individuals.

40420448,[Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive disorders].,"Cognitive disorders (CD) are a common problem in the practice of various medical specialities. Among the most common causes of severe CD (dementia) are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular diseases. The stage of non-dementia CD precedes dementia. Interventions at the non-dementia stage are believed to be more effective, prolonging the patient's quality of life at a higher functional level with a decrease in the need for nursing care. Currently, there is a pronounced underdiagnosis of CD, especially AD, which reduces the timely availability of specific drug therapy for patients and adversely affects the prognosis of the disease. The article presents basic information on the pathogenesis and methods of clinical and paraclinical diagnosis of AD and CD of vascular origin. The main markers helping to distinguish these diseases and diagnose them at the predementia stage have been identified.",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova

39289040,The GFAP proteoform puzzle: How to advance GFAP as a fluid biomarker in neurological diseases.,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a well-established biomarker of reactive astrogliosis in the central nervous system because of its elevated levels following brain injury and various neurological disorders. The advent of ultra-sensitive methods for measuring low-abundant proteins has significantly enhanced our understanding of GFAP levels in the serum or plasma of patients with diverse neurological diseases. Clinical studies have demonstrated that GFAP holds promise both as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, including but not limited to individuals with Alzheimer's disease. GFAP exhibits diverse forms and structures, herein referred to as its proteoform complexity, encompassing conformational dynamics, isoforms and post-translational modifications (PTMs). In this review, we explore how the proteoform complexity of GFAP influences its detection, which may affect the differential diagnostic performance of GFAP in different biological fluids and can provide valuable insights into underlying biological processes. Additionally, proteoforms are often disease-specific, and our review provides suggestions and highlights areas to focus on for the development of new assays for measuring GFAP, including isoforms, PTMs, discharge mechanisms, breakdown products, higher-order species and interacting partners. By addressing the knowledge gaps highlighted in this review, we aim to support the clinical translation and interpretation of GFAP in both CSF and blood and the development of reliable, reproducible and specific prognostic and diagnostic tests. To enhance disease pathology comprehension and optimise GFAP as a biomarker, a thorough understanding of detected proteoforms in biofluids is essential.",Journal of neurochemistry
39762217,Associations of plasma biomarkers with cerebral perfusion and structure in Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma biomarkers have great potential in the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, findings on their associations with cerebral perfusion and structural changes are inconclusive. We examined both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma biomarkers and cerebral blood flow (CBF), gray matter (GM) volume, and white matter (WM) integrity. Forty-eight AD patients whose diagnosis was supported by amyloid-β (Aβ) PET received measurement of plasma biomarkers with a single molecular array, including Aβ42, phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), total tau (T-tau), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and both baseline and one-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, including pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, T1-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. Correlations were found between regional CBF and several plasma biomarkers, with Aβ42 showing the strongest correlation with CBF in the left inferior temporal gyrus (r = 0.507, p = 0.001). Plasma P-tau181 and GFAP levels were correlated with GM volume in the posterior cingulate gyrus and the bilateral hippocampus and right middle temporal gyrus, respectively. Decreased CBF and GM volume in regions vulnerable to AD, such as the posterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and hippocampus, could be predicted by the levels of specific plasma biomarkers. Most biomarkers, except Aβ42, showed extensive correlations with longitudinal WM disruption. Plasma biomarkers exhibited varied correlations with brain perfusion, GM volume, and WM integrity and predicted their longitudinal changes in AD patients, suggesting their potential to reflect functional and structural changes and to monitor pathophysiological progression in the brain.",Translational psychiatry
39510227,DNA methylation biomarkers for cumulative lead exposures and cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that cumulative low-level lead exposure has adverse effects on cognitive function in the elderly. To date, the few studies that have measured bone lead exposure relied on K-X-ray fluorescence (KXRF), methods that are mostly unavailable in large community-based studies. Here, we employ a methylation-based estimation method for bone and blood lead in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. METHODS: Tibia, patella, and blood lead levels were estimated using blood DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers in 625 participants from the ADNI cohort. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Longitudinal analyses were conducted using linear mixed-effect regression models. Participants had different years of baseline (2010-2014) and follow-up visits (2014-2015). RESULTS: DNAm derived tibia and patella lead levels were negatively associated with MoCA scores throughout follow-up, while DNAm derived blood lead level was not associated with MoCA scores. On average, we observed lower MoCA scores with increasing DNAm tibia lead (per interquartile range (IQR): β = -0.23; 95% CI: -0.44, -0.03) and DNAm patella lead, albeit the latter was weaker (per IQR: β = -0.19; 95% CI: -0.41, 0.04). When stratifying by gender, women showed a stronger decrease in cognitive function with increasing DNAm tibia lead (per IQR β = -0.34; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.04) than men (per IQR β = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.42, 0.13). The estimated decrease in MoCA scores per DNAm tibia lead IQR increase was stronger among participants with one or two APOE4 alleles (per IQR β = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.01) than those with zero alleles (per IQR β = -0.14; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.10). CONCLUSION: These findings strengthen the evidence that cumulative long-term lead exposure levels are associated with decreased cognitive function in the elderly, especially among women and carriers of one or two APOE4 alleles. These findings based on whole blood methylation data corroborate previous epidemiologic studies that used KXRF for measuring bone lead.",Environmental research
39509994,Early-stage Alzheimer's disease profiling in blood achieved by multiplexing aptamer-SERS biosensors.,"Neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death globally, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerging as a significant contributor, responsible for 276 million cases in disability-adjusted life years. Conventional diagnostic methods are often invasive, costly, and place a considerable strain on global healthcare systems. In this study, we presented an innovative and efficient strategy for AD assessment through blood profiling using a multiwell glass chip integrated with aptamer-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensors. High-affinity aptamers were selected using capillary electrophoresis-based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX). A mouse brain injury model was employed to systematically investigate biomarkers indicative of physiological, vascular, and cellular damage, such as neurogranin (Nrgn), angiopoietin-2 (Angio-2), PRDX3, lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH), and τ-441, which were quantified at atto-molar levels in blood samples. Additionally, with the aid of CT-scan imaging, an aptamer-SERS assay was developed to evaluate the dynamic regulation of AD biomarkers. The aptamer-SERS biosensor system was also applied to human samples, demonstrating its capability to multiplex AD biomarkers and establish a time-dependent correlation between percentage biomarker regulation and disease progression. The innovative design, fabrication of aptamer-SERS nanoprobes, and the bio-sensing outcomes illustrate the strong potential of this approach for selective, sensitive, and quantitative early-stage AD diagnosis in clinical applications.",Biosensors & bioelectronics
39655505,Transethnic analysis identifies SORL1 variants and haplotypes protective against Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The SORL1 locus exhibits protective effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) across ancestries, yet systematic studies in diverse populations are sparse. METHODS: Logistic regression identified AD-associated SORL1 haplotypes in East Asian (N = 5249) and European (N = 8588) populations. Association analysis between SORL1 haplotypes and AD-associated traits or plasma biomarkers was conducted. The effects of non-synonymous mutations were assessed in cell-based systems. RESULTS: Protective SORL1 variants/haplotypes were identified in the East Asian and European populations. Haplotype Hap_A showed a strong protective effect against AD in East Asians, linked to less severe AD phenotypes, higher SORL1 transcript levels, and plasma proteomic changes. A missense variant within Hap_A, rs2282647-C allele, was linked to a lower risk of AD and decreased expression of a truncated SORL1 protein isoform. DISCUSSION: Our transethnic analysis revealed key SORL1 haplotypes that exert protective effects against AD, suggesting mechanisms of the protective role of SORL1 in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We examined the AD-protective mechanisms of SORL1 in the general population across diverse ancestral backgrounds by jointly analyzing data from three East Asian cohorts (ie, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Japan) and a European cohort. Comparative analysis unveiled key ethnic-specific SORL1 genetic variants and haplotypes. Among these, the SORL1 minor haplotype, Hap_A, emerged as the primary AD-protective factor in East Asians. Hap_A exerts significant AD-protective effects in both APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers. SORL1 haplotype Hap_A is associated with cognitive function, brain volume, and the activity of specific neuronal and immune-related pathways closely connected to AD risk. Protective variants within Hap_A are linked to increased SORL1 expression in human tissues. We identified an isoform-specific missense variant in Hap_A that modifies the function and levels of a truncated SORL1 protein isoform that is poorly investigated.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39821479,Plasma N-terminal tau fragment is an amyloid-dependent biomarker in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Novel fluid biomarkers for tracking neurodegeneration specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are greatly needed. METHODS: Using two independent well-characterized cohorts (n = 881 in total), we investigated the group differences in plasma N-terminal tau (NT1-tau) fragments across different AD stages and their association with cross-sectional and longitudinal amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. RESULTS: Plasma NT1-tau significantly increased in symptomatic AD and displayed positive associations with Aβ PET (positron emission tomography) and tau PET. Higher baseline NT1-tau levels predicted greater tau PET, with 2- to 10-year intervals and faster longitudinal Aβ PET increases, AD-typical neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Plasma NT1-tau showed negative correlations with baseline regional brain volume and thickness, superior to plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL) in Aβ-positive participants. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that plasma NT1-tau is an Aβ-dependent biomarker and outperforms BD-tau and NfL in detecting cross-sectional neurodegeneration in the AD continuum. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma N-terminal tau (NT1-tau) was specifically increased in the A+/T+ stage. Plasma NT1-tau was positively associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau PET (positron emission tomography) accumulations. Higher plasma NT1-tau predicted greater tau burden and faster Aβ increases. Plasma NT1-tau was more related to neurodegeneration than plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL).",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

As part of the modified Delphi approach and guideline development process (7374 publications were reviewed; 133 met inclusion criteria) an expert workgroup developed recommendations as steps in a patient-centered evaluation process. The workgroup provided a summary of validated instruments to measure symptoms in daily life (including cognition, mood and behavior, and daily function) and to test for signs of cognitive impairment in the office. This article distills this information to provide a resource to support clinicians in the implementation of this approach in clinical practice.

39988568,Influence of cognitive impairment and race on plasma p-Tau(217) in two diverse cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Factors influencing plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers remain incompletely understood. Here we evaluated Fujirebio plasma p-Tau(217) in two diverse cohorts among whom 91% underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. METHODS: Non-Hispanic White (NHW, n = 113), Black/African American (B/AA, n = 66), and Chinese American (ChA, n = 38) participants recruited from two universities were included. We examined if plasma p-Tau(217) correlated with CSF and clinical factors, differed between racial groups, and associated with novel CSF proteins. RESULTS: CSF p-Tau(181) strongly correlated with CSF p-Tau(217) (R(2 )= 0.912) which moderately correlated with plasma p-Tau(217) (R(2 )= 0.694). Plasma p-Tau(217) levels were higher with greater cognitive impairment but lower in B/AA than NHW participants even after adjusting for CSF p-Tau(181). This resulted in greater positive predictive value for NHW than B/AA participants, and could be mediated by complement or lysosomal pathways. DISCUSSION: Severity of cognitive impairment and race both influence plasma p-Tau(217) levels beyond race-associated differences in CSF p-Tau(181). HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive impairment associates with plasma p-Tau(217) independent of CSF biomarkers. Black/African Americans had lower plasma p-Tau(217) than non-Hispanic White Americans. CSF p-Tau(181) could not explain lower plasma p-Tau(217) in Black/African Americans. Plasma p-Tau(217) difference results in more false positive cases according to race. Novel CSF processes were associated with race-related plasma p-Tau(217) difference.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39776166,Plasma p-tau(217) and neurofilament/p-tau(217) ratio in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma-based biomarkers have shown promise for clinical implementation, but their accuracy in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) from syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) has yet to be fully investigated. This study assessed the potential of plasma biomarkers for differential diagnosis. METHODS: This cohort study included 374 participants (96 AD, 278 FTLD). Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)(217), neurofilament light chain (NfL), brain-derived tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the amyloid beta(1-42)/(1-40) ratio were measured. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses assessed diagnostic accuracy, and a three-range threshold approach was used to stratify patients based on the most accurate biomarker. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau(217) effectively distinguished AD from FTLD, with the NfL/p-tau(217) ratio showing superior accuracy. The three-range approach identified thresholds with 95% and 97.5% sensitivity and specificity, reducing the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing by 75% and 54%, respectively. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau(217) and the NfL/p-tau(217) ratio are promising non-invasive biomarkers for differentiating AD from FTLD, suggesting their use as a potential alternative to traditional diagnostic methods. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)(217) distinguishes Alzheimer's disease (AD) from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with high accuracy. The neurofilament light chain/p-tau(217) ratio showed the highest accuracy for differentiating AD from FTLD.

39831374,Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as fluid biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies evaluated peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mtDNA as a putative biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases, often yielding inconsistent findings. We systematically reviewed the current evidence assessing blood and CSF mtDNA levels and variant burden in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Multiple sclerosis (MS) was also included as a paradigm of chronic neuroinflammation-driven neurodegeneration. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for articles published from inception until October 2023. Studies focused on mtDNA haplogroups or hereditary pathogenic variants were excluded. Critical appraisal was performed using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-nine original studies met our a priori-defined inclusion criteria. The majority of CSF-focused studies showed (i) decreased mtDNA levels in PD and AD; (ii) increased levels in MS compared to controls. No studies evaluated CSF mtDNA in ALS. Results focused on blood cell-free and intracellular mtDNA were contradictory, even within studies evaluating the same disease. This poor reproducibility is likely due to the lack of consideration of the many factors known to affect mtDNA levels. mtDNA damage and methylation levels were increased and reduced in patients compared to controls, respectively. A few studies investigated the correlation between mtDNA and disease severity, with conflicting results. CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed studies are needed to evaluate CSF and blood mtDNA profiles as putative biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. The identification of ""mitochondrial subtypes"" of disease may enable novel precision medicine strategies to counteract neurodegeneration.",European journal of neurology

This study aims to evaluate the relationships between microstructural white matter injury, cognitive decline and AD core biomarkers. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 566 participants using peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) to quantify microstructural white matter injury. The associations of PSMD with changes in cognitive functions, AD pathologies (Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration), and volumes of AD-signature regions of interest (ROI) or hippocampus were estimated. The associations between PSMD and the incidences of clinical progression were also tested. Covariates included age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E4 status, smoking, and hypertension. RESULTS: Higher PSMD was associated with greater cognitive decline (β=-0.012, P < 0.001 for Mini-Mental State Examination score; β<0, P < 0.05 for four cognitive domains) and a higher risk of clinical progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (Hazard ratio=2.11 [1.38-3.23], P < 0.001). These associations persisted independently of amyloid status. PSMD did not predict changes in Aβ or tau levels, but predicted changes in volumes of AD-signature ROI (β=-0.003, P < 0.001) or hippocampus (β=-0.002, P = 0.010). Besides, the whole-brain PSMD could predict cognitive decline better than regional PSMDs. CONCLUSIONS: PSMD may be a valuable biomarker for predicting cognitive decline and clinical progression to MCI and AD, providing insights besides traditional Aβ and tau pathways. Further research could elucidate its role in clinical assessments and therapeutic strategies.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39316332,Interrater agreement and variability in visual reading of [18F] flutemetamol PET images.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the concordance of visual ratings of [18F] flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) images and to investigate the correlation between the agreement of each rater and the Centiloid (CL) scale. METHODS: A total of 192 participants, clinically classified as cognitively normal (CN) (n = 59), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 65), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 55), or non-AD dementia (n = 13), participated in this study. Three experts conducted visual ratings of the amyloid PET images for all 192 patients, assigning a confidence level to each rating on a three-point scale (certain, probable, or neither). The positive or negative determination of amyloid PET results was made by majority vote. The CL value was calculated using the CapAIBL pipeline. RESULTS: Overall, 101 images were determined to be positive, and 91 images were negative. Of the 101 positive images, the three raters were in complete agreement for 92 images and in disagreement for 9 images. Of the 91 negative images, the three raters were in complete agreement for 75 images and in disagreement for 16 images. Interrater reliability among the three experts was particularly high, with both Fleiss' kappa and Conger's kappa measuring 0.83 (0.76-0.89). The CL values of the unanimous positive group were significantly greater than those of the other groups, whereas the CL values of the unanimous negative group were significantly lower than those of the other groups. Images with rater disagreement had intermediate CLs. In cases with a high confidence level, the positive or negative visual ratings were in almost complete agreement. However, as confidence levels decreased, experts' visual ratings became more variable. The lower the confidence level was, the greater the number of cases with disagreement in the visual ratings. CONCLUSION: Three experts independently rated 192 amyloid PET images, achieving a high level of interrater agreement. However, in patients with intermediate amyloid accumulation, visual ratings varied. Therefore, determining positive and negative decisions in these patients should be performed with caution.",Annals of nuclear medicine
39956772,Altered functional connectivity between primary visual cortex and cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: It is known that eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions invoke different organizations of brain functional networks, such as sensorimotor, attention, and salience networks in healthy participants. Functional connectivity (FC) extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, under either EO or EC conditions, has been widely applied to explore the neural substrates of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the impact of eye conditions on FC within the AD continuum remains not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects of eye conditions on FC across the AD continuum. METHODS: FC with the primary visual cortex (V1) seed was analyzed for both EO and EC conditions in 59 amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography (PET)-negative cognitively normal (CN-), 14 Aβ-PET-positive CN+, 24 mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 15 AD individuals. RESULTS: EO and EC differently modulated FC between the V1 and cerebellum, especially the posterior vermis, in all groups. In CN-, CN+, and MCI+ groups, EO significantly facilitated FC between V1 and the cerebellum compared with the EC condition. However, the AD group showed the reverse pattern. Moreover, a sub-analysis demonstrated that the FC significantly correlated with a truncal balance measure under EO, but not EC, in participants with MCI+ and AD. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the FC between the V1 and cerebellum changed in AD. This finding may partially explain the impaired truncal balance and tendency to fall down in AD. This study suggests that analyzing FC under EO and EC conditions may provide a new functional biomarker for AD.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39711511,Proteomic signatures of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementias: A comparative analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify unique proteomic signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). METHODS: We conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of 33 post mortem brains from AD, DLB, and PDD individuals without dementia focusing on prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal cortices, using weighted gene co-expression network analyses with differential enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Network modules revealed hub proteins common to all dementias. Lewy body dementias differed from AD by reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1), whereas DLB was distinguished from both AD and PDD by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) across brain regions. An increase in mitochondrial and synaptic proteins was related to better cognition whereas enrichment in the extracellular matrix, complement system, and autophagy proteins was associated with greater cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: Our study offers valuable insights into the network-based biomarker characterization of molecular signatures of AD, DLB, and PDD. HIGHLIGHTS: Reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1) differentiated Lewy body dementias from Alzheimer's disease (AD) across multiple brain regions. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was distinguished from both AD and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) levels across brain regions. Key mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins (e.g., COX7A2, TOMM40L, NDUFV1), and synaptic proteins (e.g., GABRB3, GABRB2, GLUA3, GLUA4, SNAP47, dynamin1) were more abundant in preserved cognitive states. Extracellular matrix proteins and members of the complement system (decorin, biglycan, C4A, C4B) showed a strong positive correlation with cognitive decline.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39894421,Shared molecular signature in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia: A systematic review of the reelin signaling pathway.,"The Reelin signaling pathway, particularly the RELN-APOER2-DAB1 complex, has emerged as a key contributor to the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Schizophrenia (SZ). Despite being distinct clinical conditions, these disorders exhibit similar patterns of cognitive decline, including early disruptions in synaptic function and memory impairments. Notably, individuals with SZ have a 2-4 fold increased risk of developing AD or other dementias, highlighting potential shared molecular mechanisms, and positioning Reelin as a pivotal link between them. This systematic review explores the role of Reelin and its signaling components across these disorders. In AD, Reelin disruption correlates with hallmark features such as Tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-beta accumulation, and cognitive deficits. In SZ, alterations in Reelin signaling, including epigenetic modifications affecting RELN expression, are linked to disruptions in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the parietal and prefrontal cortices. Additionally, genomic studies reveal specific RELN variants and allelic imbalances that may influence disease severity and treatment response in SZ, suggesting RELN's role as a potential biomarker for therapeutic outcomes. Region-specific Reelin alterations in both AD and SZ suggest differing impacts yet underscore a potential common molecular origin. Our findings highlight the Reelin pathway as a molecular convergence point, warranting further investigation as a therapeutic and diagnostic target for AD, SZ, and potentially other neuropsychiatric disorders. The interplay between genetic and epigenetic regulation of RELN may provide novel insights into neurodegeneration, with implications for personalized intervention strategies in AD and SZ.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews
39689339,Posterior Cortical Atrophy Due to Alzheimer Disease in a Person With Down Syndrome: A Case Report.,"OBJECTIVES: Atypical variants are rare in genetically determined Alzheimer disease (AD). This case describes a patient with Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer disease (DSAD) who presented with symptoms of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). METHODS: We conducted a clinical and cognitive evaluation, APOE genotyping, determination of AD biomarkers in CSF, structural MRI, [18F]FDG-PET, and tau-PET ([18F]PI2620) scans. RESULTS: A 39-year-old man with DS and mild intellectual disability presented with progressive visuoperceptual disturbances over 18 months. Examination revealed global cognitive impairment, with notable visual agnosia and neglect. The patient also exhibited significant constructive and oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia, alexia, agraphia, and prosopagnosia. The patient was determined to be APOE3 homozygous, and CSF analysis was consistent with AD pathophysiology. T1-weighted MRI revealed predominant parieto-occipital atrophy. FDG-PET showed significant bilateral hypometabolism in the parietotemporal and occipital cortices, and tau-PET demonstrated pathologic uptake in the parietal, precuneus/posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and occipital cortices. DISCUSSION: This well-characterized case of PCA syndrome due to AD in a very young patient with DS demonstrates the occurrence of atypical presentations in DS that might be overshadowed by the baseline intellectual disability associated with DS.",Neurology
39778036,Identification of risk factors and development of a predictive nomogram for sarcopenia in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia, with its complex diagnostic process, is a likely independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, research on the clinical characteristics and biomarkers of AD patients with sarcopenia (ADSA) is limited. METHODS: This study included 180 ADSA and 188 AD patients without sarcopenia (ADNSA), and evaluated demographics, cognitive function, motor capacity, emotional state, and daily living abilities. RESULTS: ADSA patients were older, with worse motor and cognitive functions, more severe depression, poorer social functioning, and lower daily living abilities compared to ADNSA patients. Multivariate regression identified age, low Frailty Rating Scale (FRS) scores, low serum albumin level, and low creatinine/cystatin C ratio (CCR) as risk factors for sarcopenia. A nomogram model based on these indicators demonstrated high discriminative power and clinical utility. DISCUSSION: Sarcopenia significantly affects AD patients' various functions. The nomogram model aids in the early detection of and personalized interventions for sarcopenia in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Sarcopenia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the coexistence of sarcopenia affects various functions and quality of life in patients with AD. Serum albumin and Frailty Rating Scale (FRS) scores are significantly associated with both sarcopenia and cognitive assessment indicators in AD patients with sarcopenia (ADSA). The combined sarcopenia nomogram model with indexes of age at diagnosis, creatinine/cystatin C ratio (CCR), FRS score, and albumin levels can aid in effectively identifying and personalizing interventions for sarcopenia in the AD population.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39822132,Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles as a liquid biopsy for brain insulin dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel blood-based biomarkers for various pathologies. The development of methods to enrich cell-specific EVs from biofluids has enabled us to monitor difficult-to-access organs, such as the brain, in real time without disrupting their function, thus serving as liquid biopsy. Burgeoning evidence indicates that the contents of neuron-derived EVs (NDEs) in blood reveal dynamic alterations that occur during neurodegenerative pathogenesis, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), reflecting a disease-specific molecular signature. Among these AD-specific molecular changes is brain insulin-signaling dysregulation, which cannot be assessed clinically in a living patient and remains an unexplained co-occurrence during AD pathogenesis. This review is focused on delineating how NDEs in the blood may begin to close the gap between identifying molecular changes associated with brain insulin dysregulation reliably in living patients and its connection to AD. This approach could lead to the identification of novel early and less-invasive diagnostic molecular biomarkers for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEs) could be isolated from peripheral blood. NDEs in blood reflect the molecular signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain insulin-signaling dysregulation plays a critical role in AD. NDEs in blood could predict brain insulin-signaling dysregulation. NDEs offer novel early and less-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for AD.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39838411,"Exploring the ability of plasma pTau217, pTau181 and beta-amyloid in mirroring cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profile of Mild Cognitive Impairment by the fully automated Lumipulse(®) platform.","BACKGROUND: The approval of new disease-modifying therapies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency makes it necessary to optimize non-invasive and cost-effective tools for the identification of subjects at-risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Plasma biomarkers are excellent candidates. However, their ability to reflect the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile - that remains to date the gold standard for the biochemical diagnosis of AD - needs to be confirmed and validated before their implementation in clinical practice. The aims of this study are to analyse the correlation between CSF and plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 and pTau181, and to assess the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers in a cohort of subjects affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). METHODS: The study was performed on 306 subjects affected by MCI, enrolled in the context of the Italian Interceptor Project. Aβ40, Aβ42 and pTau181 were analysed in plasma and CSF, and pTau217 was measured in plasma. The fully automated chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay and the Lumipulse(®) G600II (Fujirebio) instrument were used for all measurements. We analysed the correlations between CSF and plasma biomarkers and the differences of plasma biomarker concentrations after grouping MCI cases according to AT classification of CSF AD biomarker profiles. RESULTS: We found statistically significant positive correlations between CSF and plasma Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and pTau181. All the biomarkers, except Aβ40, showed differences in A+ vs. A-, A+T+ vs. A-T- and A+T- vs. A-T- patients. Moreover, Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 plasma levels were lower in A+T- compared to A-T- and A-T+ groups, and pTau181 and pTau217 plasma levels were higher in A+T+ compared to A+T-. Aβ42/Aβ40 and pTau217 showed a robust performance in distinguishing A+ from A- (AUC = 0.857 and 0.862, respectively) and A+T+ from A-T- (AUC = 0.866 and 0.911) subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that plasma biomarkers, and especially Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and pTau217, are promising candidates for the early detection of AD pathology.",Fluids and barriers of the CNS
40046733,Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Progression to Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is a condition that impairs cognition, memory, and behavior. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage before AD, urgently needs the development of prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD. METHOD: This study used machine learning methods to predict whether MCI subjects would develop AD, highlighting the importance of biomarkers (biological indicators from neuroimaging, such as MRI and PET scans, and molecular assays from cerebrospinal fluid or blood) and non-biomarker features in AD research and clinical practice. These indicators aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and the development of potential treatments for MCI subjects. Using baseline data, which includes measurements of different biomarkers, we predicted disease progression at the patient's last visit. The Shapley value explanation (SHAP) technique was used to identify key features for predicting patient progression. RESULTS: The study used the ADNI database to evaluate the effectiveness of eight classification methods for predicting progression from MCI to AD. Four fundamental data sampling approaches were compared to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting. The SHAP technique improved the ability to identify biomarkers and non-biomarker features, enhancing the prediction of disease progression. NEAR-MISS was found to be the most advantageous sampling method, while XGBoost was found to be the superior classification method, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive power. CONCLUSION: The proposed SHAP for feature selection combined with XGBoost may provide improved predictive accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's patients.",Journal of medical and biological engineering
40498685,Machine learning driven biomarker selection for medical diagnosis.,"Recent advances in experimental methods have enabled researchers to collect data on thousands of analytes simultaneously. This has led to correlational studies that associated molecular measurements with diseases such as Alzheimer's, Liver, and Gastric Cancer. However, the use of thousands of biomarkers selected from the analytes is not practical for real-world medical diagnosis and is likely undesirable due to potentially formed spurious correlations. In this study, we evaluate 4 different methods for biomarker selection and 5 different machine learning (ML) classifiers for identifying correlations-evaluating 20 approaches in all. We found that contemporary methods outperform previously reported logistic regression in cases where 3 and 10 biomarkers are permitted. When specificity is fixed at 0.9, ML approaches produced a sensitivity of 0.240 (3 biomarkers) and 0.520 (10 biomarkers), while standard logistic regression provided a sensitivity of 0.000 (3 biomarkers) and 0.040 (10 biomarkers). We also noted that causal-based methods for biomarker selection proved to be the most performant when fewer biomarkers were permitted, while univariate feature selection was the most performant when a greater number of biomarkers were permitted.",PloS one
39797935,"The role of the Mediterranean diet in reducing the risk of cognitive impairement, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.","Age-related cognitive impairment and dementia pose a significant global health, social, and economic challenge. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically been viewed as the leading cause of dementia, recent evidence reveals the considerable impact of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), which now accounts for nearly half of all dementia cases. The Mediterranean diet-characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil-has been widely recognized for its cardiovascular benefits and may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. To investigate the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive health, we conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. The studies included in the meta-nalysis examined the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the incidence of dementia and AD. We applied a random-effects model to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed heterogeneity through I-square statistics. Forest plots, funnel plots, and Z-score plots were used to visualize study outcomes. Of the 324 full-text records reviewed, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined HR for cognitive impairment among those adhering to the Mediterranean diet was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89); for dementia, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95); and for AD, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-0.82), indicating substantial protective effects. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies, though Z-score plots suggested sufficient sample sizes to support reliable conclusions for each condition. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirms that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with an 11-30% reduction in the risk of age-related cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD. These findings underscore the Mediterranean diet's potential as a central element in neuroprotective public health strategies to mitigate the global impact of cognitive decline and dementia and to promote healthier cognitive aging.",GeroScience
39531949,Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease: A study with [(11)C]PBR28 PET and cerebrospinal fluid markers.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) with [(11)C]PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and the relationship to dopaminergic functioning measured with 6-[(18)F]-fluoro-L-dopa ([(18)F]FDOPA) PET. METHODS: The clinical cohort consisted of 20 subjects with PD and 51 healthy controls (HC). All HC and 15 PD participants underwent [(11)C]PBR28 High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) PET for the quantitative assessment of cerebral binding to the translocator protein (TSPO), a neuroinflammation marker. CSF samples were available from 17 subjects with PD and 21 HC and were examined for soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), chitinase 3-like 1 protein (YKL-40), neurogranin (NG), alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and oligo-alpha-synuclein. All subjects with PD underwent [(18)F]FDOPA HRRT PET. RESULTS: While the subjects with PD and HC did not differ in the total volume of distribution (V(T)) of [(11)C]PBR28 in any studied brain regions, higher levels of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration CSF biomarkers sTREM2 and NG, respectively were associated with more severe motor symptoms evaluated by The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) (r = 0.52, p = 0.041 and r = 0.59, p = 0.016 respectively). Additionally, in the PD group increased [(11)C]PBR28 V(T) in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra (SN) was related to higher levels of neuroinflammation biomarker YKL-40 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Associations between CSF biomarkers, motor disability and [(11)C]PBR28 V(T) in the striatum and SN may support a role for neuroinflammation in PD.",Parkinsonism & related disorders
39910935,Alzheimer's disease: assessing the therapeutic potential of anti-Aβ (Beta-Amyloid) treatments.,"One of the most common forms of dementia and a neurodegenerative illness is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is distinguished by impaired memory and cognitive dysfunction. Decades of research have been devoted to determining its etiology, pathogenic processes, and biomarkers to facilitate early identification and clinical investigations for therapy. Neural atrophy and broken connections between neurons are the outcomes of the illness. The amyloid beta (Aβ) cascade is among the most widely recognized and important hypotheses of the numerous hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of AD. This theory suggests that the breakdown of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces Aβ monomers. These monomers are then converted into hazardous oligomers, which in turn form β-sheets, fibrils, and plaques after being formed. The amyloid cascade theory was covered in this review, along with a summary of how it is used to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's. Specifically, we covered the drawbacks, potential, and significant unsolved issues with the anti-Aβ therapy that is now in use, as well as plans for more research and the creation of more workable Aβ-targeted methods to optimize AD early detection and management.","Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)"
39587787,Clinical and biological underpinnings of longitudinal atrophy pattern progression in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently enabled to identify four distinct Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes: hippocampal sparing (HpSp), typical AD (tAD), limbic predominant (Lp), and minimal atrophy (MinAtr). To date, however, the natural history of these subtypes, especially regarding the presence of subjects switching to other MRI patterns and their clinical and biological differences, remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and biological underpinnings of longitudinal atrophy pattern progression in AD. METHODS: 251 AD patients (16 with significant memory concern, 66 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 125 with late MCI, and 44 with AD dementia) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were assigned to their baseline MRI atrophy subtype using Freesurfer-derived cortical:hippocampal volumes ratio. Switching to other MRI patterns was investigated on longitudinal scans, and patients were accordingly classified as ""switching"" and ""stable"". Logistic regression models were applied to identify predictors of switching to other MRI patterns. RESULTS: 40% of Lp, 26% of HpSp, and 35% of MinAtr cases switched to other MRI patterns, with tAD representing the destination subtype of all switching HpSp and Lp, and the majority of MinAtr. At baseline significant clinical, cognitive and biomarkers differences were observed across the four subtypes. Only clinical and cognitive variables, however, were significantly associated with switch to other MRI patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest convergent directions of disease progression across atypical and typical AD forms, at least in a subset of AD subjects, and highlight the importance of deep-phenotyping approaches to understand AD heterogeneity.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39503608,"Elevated serum sodium is linked to increased amyloid-dependent tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.","Vascular dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While sodium is essential for maintaining vascular function, its role in AD pathology remains unclear. We included 353 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), assessing serum sodium levels, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive function. An independent sample (N = 471) with available CSF sodium-related proteins and AD biomarkers was also included. Associations between serum sodium levels and AD pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognition were evaluated using linear regression models. Spearman's correlation analyses assessed the relationships between CSF sodium-related proteins and AD biomarkers. Higher serum sodium levels were associated with increased AD pathology, reduced hippocampal volume, and greater cognitive decline (all p < 0.05). The relationship between serum sodium and amyloid PET was evident in several AD-susceptible brain regions, including the neocortex and limbic system. Individuals with high serum sodium exhibited higher tau pathology, lower hippocampal volume, and more severe cognitive decline per unit increase in amyloid PET compared to those with low serum sodium (all p < 0.05). Among the 14 CSF sodium-related proteins, which were inter-correlated, six were significantly correlated with CSF AD pathology and amyloid PET, while two were correlated with hippocampal volume and cognitive function, with sodium channel subunit beta-2 (SCN2B) and sodium channel subunit beta-3 (SCN3B) showing the strongest correlations. These findings underscore the crucial role of serum sodium in AD progression, highlighting a potential network of sodium dysregulation involved in AD pathology. Targeting sodium may offer a novel therapeutic approach to slowing AD progression, particularly by impeding the progression of amyloid-related downstream events.",Journal of neurochemistry
39985478,Role of tau versus TDP-43 pathology on medial temporal lobe atrophy in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging is an important biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While hippocampal atrophy was thought to result from tau tangles in AD, different neuropathologies can lead to hippocampal atrophy, especially TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. In this narrative review, we evaluate existing studies on the relative contribution of tau and TDP-43 pathology to medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. We report a clear association of both tau and TDP-43 neuropathology with MTL atrophy, even after correcting for other neuropathologies. Next, we discuss a potential synergism between tau and TDP-43 and the relative timing of the effects of both neuropathologies. Finally, avenues for future research will be discussed. A better understanding of the interplay between tau and TDP-43 neuropathologies and their effect on atrophy will help with the development of more specific biomarkers for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and pinpointing of the optimal timing for testing anti-tau and anti-TDP-43 treatments in trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Both tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology contribute to medial temporal lobe atrophy. There is a positive association between tau and TDP-43 and potentially a synergism. It is unclear if tau and TDP-43 have an additive or synergistic effect on atrophy. The relative timing of the tau and TDP-43 effects on atrophy remains unclear. Clarifying the interplay between tau and TDP-43 will help improve magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39823562,Quantitative Assessment of the Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on Plasma P-Tau217 Concentrations.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) concentrations, potentially confounding the utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements as a marker of amyloid pathology in individuals with suspected Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we quantitatively investigate the relationship of plasma p-tau217 concentrations vs estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in individuals with CKD with and without amyloid pathology. METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of data from 2 observational cohorts from either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohorts. p-Tau217 was determined using the ALZpath Simoa p-tau217 immunoassay and an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay that simultaneously measures p-tau217 and nonphosphorylated-tau217 (np-tau217) to determine %p-tau217 ([p-tau217/nonphosphorylated-tau217]) × 100%) (C(2)N Diagnostics). Amyloid positivity was defined by amyloid-PET and a centiloid of ≥25. Log-log linear regression fits were used to quantitatively predict increases in plasma p-tau217 associated with decreasing eGFR. RESULTS: Participants (n = 202, mean age of 78 years, 38% female) with diagnoses of cognitive unimpairment (n = 109), mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), and dementia (n = 22) were included. In all, 114 (56%) of all participants were amyloid-PET positive (A+). In addition, 86 (43%) of all participants were classified as having CKD (CKD stages 3-4). p-Tau217 concentrations were significantly higher in A- participants with an eGFR of <60 (mL/min/1.73 m(2)), as compared with those with eGFR >60 A- participants. For an eGFR of 45 vs 60 in the A- cohort, the calculated percentage changes were +31%, +55%, and +19%, for ALZpath p-tau217, C(2)N p-tau217, and C(2)N %p-tau217, respectively. For the A+ cohort, the corresponding calculated percentage changes were +17%, +15%, and -5%, respectively. DISCUSSION: CKD was associated with increased p-tau217 concentrations when measuring p-tau217 by ALZpath and C(2)N methodologies, but the effect was mitigated by the use of %p-tau217. These results indicate limitations for the utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements in individuals with significant renal impairment (eGFR <45 or CKD stage 3b or greater). Determination of eGFR should be considered to avoid inaccurate classification of the presence of AD-related pathology by plasma p-tau217 in individuals with CKD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in individuals with CKD stage 3 (especially stage 3b) or higher, p-tau217 concentrations are increased, with a greater increase in amyloid-PET-negative individuals.",Neurology
39623970,Classifying cognitive impairment based on FDG-PET and combined T1-MRI and rs-fMRI: An ADNI study.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a memory impairment among non-demented adults. It is a condition that increases the risk of dementia, notably due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI is heterogeneous and there is a need for novel diagnostic approaches. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging provides robust AD biomarker characteristics, while anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer complementary information. OBJECTIVE: Classify MCI and cognitively normal (CN) adults using FDG-PET images; predict individuals with MCI that convert to AD dementia; determine if MRI can achieve comparable performance to FDG-PET classification. METHODS: Four ADNI cohorts were created. Cohort 1: 805 participants (MCI n = 455; CN n = 350) that underwent FDG-PET. FDG-PET images were inputs to a one-channel 3-dimensional (3D) DenseNet deep learning model. Cohort 2: 348 participants (MCI n = 174; CN n = 174) with MRI and functional MRI. Cohort 3: overlapping cases from cohorts 1 and 2 (MCI n = 70; CN n = 70). Cohort 4: 336 participants (MCI-converters n = 168; MCI-stable n = 168) with FDG-PET from cohort 1. The one/two-channel models' inputs were T1-weighted MRI and/or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations images, with classification metrics evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: The FDG-PET model achieved 88.02%±3.82 accuracy for MCI versus CN classification, with 88.70%±4.70 sensitivity and 87.14%±5.03 specificity. Neither MRI model outperformed the FDG-PET model, as the highest MRI-based accuracy was 76.86%±1.95. The FDG-PET model achieved 63.23%±4.68 accuracy in classifying MCI-converters versus MCI-stable. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET images produced the highest accuracy in classifying MCI versus CN. While MRI-based approaches were inferior to FDG-PET, multi-contrast MRI still offers value for neurodegeneration classification.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39956938,Frailty increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease in non-demented individuals: A longitudinal cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty, which is considered a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia, continues to generate debate when it comes to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, the underlying pathological mechanisms linking frailty to AD remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between frailty and the risk of AD while elucidating the connections between frailty, AD biomarkers, and cognitive function. METHODS: Total of 829 non-frail (261 robust, 568 pre-frail) and 94 frail individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were recruited. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression assessed AD risk across diverse frail statuses in 923 non-demented individuals. Multiple linear regression, mixed effects models and causal mediation analyses bootstrapped 10,000 iterations were conducted to examined underlying associations. RESULTS: The frail group had a 67.7% increased risk of AD than non-frail group (HR = 1.677; 95%CI, 1.179-2.385; p = 0.004), a 61.8% increased risk of AD than pre-frail group (HR = 1.618; 95%CI, 1.131-2.316; p = 0.009) and a far higher risk of AD than robust group (HR = 2.011; 95%CI, 1.263-3.202; p = 0.003). Frailty was associated with cognitive decline (global cognition, memory and executive function), whole brain and hippocampus atrophy, and ventricle dilation. Higher frail degree predicted faster cognitive decline, brain atrophy and ventricle dilation. Frailty's association with cognition was partially mediated by volume of whole brain (29.54%-30.17% of total effect), hippocampus (18.21%-24.55% of total effect), and ventricle (baseline, 7.62%-10.87% of total effect; change rate, 13.30%-24.33% of total effect). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty as a potential risk factor for AD, further mechanisms investigation is warranted; mitigating frailty could potentially contribute to AD prevention.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39031716,Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials: What Have We Learned From Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia worldwide with rising prevalence, incidence and mortality. Despite many decades of research, there remains an unmet need for disease-modifying treatment that can significantly alter the progression of disease. Recently, with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals, there have been tremendous advances in this area, with agents demonstrating effects on cognition and biomarkers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an instrumental role in these trials. This review article aims to outline how MRI is used for screening eligibility, monitoring safety and measuring efficacy in clinical trials, leaning on the landscape of past and recent AD clinical trials that have used MRI as examples; further, insight on promising MRI biomarkers for future trials is provided.

38935232,The Link Between Matrix Metalloproteinases and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major contributor to dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disorder. In AD pathophysiology, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-proteolytic enzymes, best known to be responsible for remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix-were suggested to play an important role. Due to the diverse nature of the published data and frequent inconsistent results presented in available papers, it was considered essential to analyze all aspects of MMP literature with respect to AD pathophysiology and attempt to outline a unifying concept for understanding their role in AD. Thus, the main contribution of this review article is to summarize the most recent research on the participation of MMP in AD pathophysiology obtained using the cell cultures to understand the molecular principles of their action. Furthermore, an updated comprehensive view regarding this topic based exclusively on papers from human studies is provided as well. It can be concluded that determining the exact role of any particular MMPs in the AD pathophysiology holds promise for establishing their role as potential biomarkers reflecting the severity or progression of this disease or for developing new therapeutic agents targeting the processes that lead to AD.",Molecular neurobiology
39588748,Heritability of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers: A nuclear twin family design.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heritable disease (60%-80%). Amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are plasma biomarkers for AD. Clinical biomarker research would be served by an understanding of the sources of variance in these markers. METHODS: Blood concentrations of Aβ42/40, NfL, and GFAP of twins and their families (monozygotic twins: 1574, dizygotic twins: 1266, other: 3657) were analyzed on the Simoa HD-X. Twin-family models were used to estimate proportional genetic contributions to the variance in biomarker levels. RESULTS: Heritability estimates were 16% for Aβ42/40, 42% for NfL, and 60% for GFAP. NfL and GFAP were significantly correlated with each other (0.37) but not with Aβ42/40. DISCUSSION: The heritability of Aβ42/40 (16%) is lower than the heritability of AD, suggesting strong environmental influences on this biomarker. The lack of correlation between NfL/GFAP and Aβ42/40 indicates these markers may be on different biological pathways. HIGHLIGHTS: Heritability is found for glial fibrillary acidic protein (60%), neurofilament light chain (42%), and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 (16%) plasma levels. Aβ42/40 plasma levels are sensitive to person-specific environmental influences.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39492772,Cutting-edge Strategies for Overcoming Therapeutic Barriers in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the hardest neurodegenerative diseases to treat due to its enduring cognitive deterioration and memory loss. Despite extensive research, few viable treatment approaches have been found; these are mostly due to several barriers, such as the disease's complex biology, limited pharmaceutical efficacy, and the BBB. This presentation discusses current strategies for addressing these therapeutic barriers to enhance AD treatment. Innovative drug delivery methods including liposomes, exosomes, and nanoparticles may be able to pass the blood-brain barrier and allow medicine to enter specific brain regions. These innovative strategies of medicine distribution reduce systemic side effects by improving absorption. Moreover, the development of disease-modifying treatments that target tau protein tangles, amyloid-beta plaques, and neuroinflammation offers the chance to influence the course of the illness rather than only treat its symptoms. Furthermore, gene therapy and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have surfaced as potentially groundbreaking methods for addressing the underlying genetic defects associated with AD. Furthermore, novel approaches to patient care may involve the utilization of existing medications having neuroprotective properties, such as those for diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Furthermore, biomarker research and personalized medicine have made individualized therapy approaches possible, ensuring that patients receive the best care possible based on their unique genetic and molecular profiles.",Current pharmaceutical design
39852100,Resonant Young's Slit Interferometer for Sensitive Detection of Low-Molecular-Weight Biomarkers.,"The detection of low-molecular-weight biomarkers is essential for diagnosing and managing various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. A biomarker's low molecular weight is a challenge for label-free optical modalities, as the phase change they detect is directly proportional to the mass bound on the sensor's surface. To address this challenge, we used a resonant Young's slit interferometer geometry and implemented several innovations, such as phase noise matching and optimisation of the fringe spacing, to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio. As a result, we achieved a limit of detection of 2.9 × 10(-6) refractive index units (RIU). We validated our sensor's low molecular weight capability by demonstrating the detection of Aβ-42, a 4.5 kDa peptide indicative of Alzheimer's disease, and reached the clinically relevant pg/mL regime. This system builds on the guided mode resonance modality we previously showed to be compatible with handheld operation using low-cost components. We expect this development will have far-reaching applications beyond Aβ-42 and become a workhorse tool for the label-free detection of low-molecular-weight biomarkers across a range of disease types.",Biosensors
39773090,Association of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 with Alzheimer's disease: A new therapeutic prospect.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common disease associated with cognitive dysfunction, which is closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical manifestations, pathological changes and prevention. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) can lower blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion. Besides, it can affect cognitive function through the neuroprotective effect of DPP-4 substrates, such as glucose-dependent insulin peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1, the proteolytic effect on amyloid-β and the protective effect on neuronal structure. This review discusses the relationship between cognitive impairment in T2DM and in AD, summarizes the effect of DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) on improving cognitive impairment in these two diseases based on the current studies. Given the lack of clinical randomized trials that evaluate the effect of DPP-4i on AD, this review is expected to provide preclinical evidence for DPP-4i as a potential therapy for the treatment and prevention of AD.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
40151396,Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases in regulatory decision-making by the European Medicines Agency.,"INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers (BMs) are valuable tools to facilitate early diagnosis of (subtypes of) diseases, improve patient selection and stratification, and detect therapeutic effects or safety concerns. This study explores the extent to which BMs are utilized in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), as well as topics of discussion regarding BMs in regulatory advice- and decision-making processes and sharing of BM-related data. METHODS: The European Medicines Agency's marketing authorization application (MAA), qualification (QA/QO), and scientific advice (SA) procedures regarding NDDs were screened, and those that mention BMs were analyzed. Data were extracted on the intended disease, BM type, and context of use proposed by applicants. BMs were categorized based on both nature and function. RESULTS: In total, 105 procedures that discussed BMs were analyzed, 57 SAs (January 2020 to December 2022), 19 QAs/QOs (January 2008 to December 2023), and 29 MAAs (January 1995 to December 2023). The majority involved Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 30), Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 9), and multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 33). Imaging BMs were the most common type of BMs discussed, and most BMs were used as pharmacodynamic/response measures. The acceptance and role of BMs differed between AD, PD, MS, and other NDDs. In regulatory procedures for AD, for example, diagnostic BMs guiding patient selection were commonly discussed, whereas in MAAs for MS, imaging BMs (particularly lesions) were generally accepted as supportive/secondary endpoints. DISCUSSION: Despite the established role of certain BMs, mainly imaging BMs for MS, there remains a major need for more precise and reliable BMs to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring for NDDs. To implement novel BMs and facilitate development of new treatments and to eventually improve clinical practice, robust evidence bases showcasing biological plausibility or clear clinical benefits are essential. Collaboration and data-sharing among stakeholders is vital in generating this evidence and enhancing the understanding and management of NDDs. HIGHLIGHTS: The European Medicines Agency's marketing authorization applications and qualification and scientific advice procedures.One hundred five procedures were analyzed regarding neurodegenerative diseases that discuss biomarkers.We found that acceptance and role of biomarkers differ per disease.Biological plausibility/clinical benefits are essential for biomarker implementation.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40177250,Global trends and prospects of ocular biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis necessitates the development of novel biomarkers that ensure high diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness in blood tests. Recent studies have identified a significant association between ocular symptoms and the pathological processes of AD, suggesting the potential for effective ocular biomarkers. This bibliometric analysis aims to explore recent advancements and research trends in ocular biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. METHODS: Articles related to AD and ocular biomarkers were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. These articles were analyzed using bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer, R-bibliometrix, and CiteSpace. RESULTS: A total of 623 papers were included in the analysis, revealing a steady increase in publications since 2012. The United States produced the most publications, followed by China and Italy. Notably, authors affiliated with Complutense University of Madrid in Spain and Sapienza University of Rome in Italy made significant contributions, demonstrating robust internal collaborations. The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease published the most articles pertaining to ocular science and neuroscience. Keyword analysis indicates evolving trends in ocular markers for AD from 2005 to 2024, transitioning from diagnostic techniques (e.g., ""spectroscopy,"" ""cerebrospinal fluid"") to pathological mechanisms (e.g., ""oxidative stress"") and advanced imaging technologies (e.g., ""optical coherence tomography angiography""). CONCLUSION: The bibliometric analysis highlights key research hotspots related to ocular markers for AD, documenting the shift from basic diagnostic techniques to advanced imaging methods and the discovery of novel biomarkers. Future research may investigate the potential of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography, tear component analysis, eye movement assessments, and artificial intelligence to enhance early detection of AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39741782,Can brain network connectivity facilitate the clinical development of disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer drugs?,"The preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease represents a crucial time window for therapeutic intervention but requires the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers that are sensitive to the effects of disease-modifying drugs. Amyloid peptide and tau proteins, the main histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, have been widely used as biomarkers of anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. However, these biomarkers do not fully capture the multiple biological pathways of the brain. Indeed, robust amyloid-target engagement by anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies has recently translated into modest cognitive and clinical benefits in Alzheimer's disease patients, albeit with potentially life-threatening side effects. Moreover, targeting the tau pathway has yet to result in any positive clinical outcomes. Findings from computational neuroscience have demonstrated that brain regions do not work in isolation but are interconnected within complex network structures. Brain connectivity studies suggest that misfolded proteins can spread through these connections, leading to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease is a pathology of network disconnectivity. Based on these assumptions, here we discuss how incorporating brain connectivity outcomes could better capture global brain functionality and, in conjunction with traditional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, could facilitate the clinical development of new disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs.",Brain communications
39748415,Cerebrospinal fluid β2-microglobulin promotes the tau pathology through microglia-astrocyte communication in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β2-microglobulin (β2M) has been demonstrated as an important factor in β-amyloid (Aβ) neurotoxicity and a potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, more investigation is required to ascertain the relationship between β2M and glial activities in AD pathogenesis. METHODS: In this study, 211 participants from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with CSF and Plasma β2M, CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), Aβ(42), phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) were divided into four groups, stage 0, 1, 2, and suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) based on the National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria. Multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects models, and causal mediation analyses bootstrapped 10,000 iterations were used to investigate the underlying associations among β2M and CSF biomarkers at baseline and during a longitudinal visit. RESULTS: CSF β2M concentration decreased with amyloid in stage 1 compared with stage 0 and increased with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in stage 2 and SNAP compared with stage 1. Moreover, CSF β2M level was positively correlated with the Aβ(42) (β = 0.230), P-tau (β = 0.564), T-tau (β = 0.603), GFAP (β = 0.552), and sTREM2 (β = 0.641) (all P < 0.001). CSF β2M was only longitudinally correlated with T-tau change. The correlation of CSF β2M with P-tau (proportion = 25.4%, P < 0.001) and T-tau (proportion = 26.7%, P < 0.001) was partially mediated by GFAP in total participants, reproduced in late-life individuals. Furthermore, the astrocyte cascade also partially mediated the pathological relationship between CSF β2M and tau pathology (β2M → GFAP → YKL-40 → P-tau/T-tau, IE: 0.424-0.435, all P < 0.001). Nevertheless, the mediation effects of sTREM2 were not significant. Additionally, there was no association between plasma β2M and CSF biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: CSF β2M is dynamic in AD pathology and associated with neuroinflammation. CSF GFAP might mediate the association between β2M and tau pathology, complementing the existing research on the effect of β2M in AD pathology and providing a new perspective on treatment.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
40225565,A new nano-encapsulated TSPO ligand reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease model.,"Rationale: The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is mainly expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane and is implicated in inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation. TSPO expression in activated microglia is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing both a biomarker and therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Methods: We synthesized a new TSPO ligand, TEMNAP, a hybrid of temazepam, a compound well known for its ability to bind TSPO, and naproxen, a drug with anti-inflammatory properties that is potentially useful to mitigate neuroinflammation. TEMNAP was encapsulated in a self-assembling nanoparticle transferrin-targeted (SANP-TF-TEMNAP) for brain delivery. The effectiveness of TEMNAP in mitigating inflammatory processes and cognitive behavior was investigated in genetically modified Tg2576 mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease. Its effect on neuroinflammation has also been explored in lipopolysaccharide-activated BV2 microglial cells. Results: SANP-TEMNAP significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers in activated microglia, and this effect was abrogated by TSPO silencing. More importantly, TEMNAP was mass-spectrometrically detected in the hippocampus and cortex of Tg2576 mice after SANP-TF-TEMNAP intraperitoneal administration, preventing hippocampal neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function. Conclusions: These results emphasize the following: (i) the role of transferrin-conjugated self-assembling nanoparticles (SANP-TF) as CNS nanovectors, and (ii) the potential therapeutic effectiveness of peripherally administered SANP-TF-TEMNAP in preventing neuroinflammation associated with cognitive decline.",Theranostics
40000573,Methods to crosswalk between cognitive test scores using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies use multiple different instruments to measure dementia-related outcomes, making head-to-head comparisons of interventions difficult. METHODS: To address this gap, we developed two methods to crosswalk estimated treatment effects on cognitive outcomes that are flexible, broadly applicable, and do not rely on strong distributional assumptions. RESULTS: We present two methods to crosswalk effect estimates using one measure to estimates using another measure, illustrated with global cognitive measures from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we develop crosswalks for the following measures and associated change scores over time: the clinical dementia rating scale sum of box (CDR-SB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Finally, a setting in which crosswalking is not appropriate is illustrated with plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentration and global cognitive measures. DISCUSSION: Given the inconsistent collection and reporting of dementia and cognitive outcomes across studies, these crosswalking methods offer a valuable approach to harmonizing and comparing results reported on different scales. HIGHLIGHTS: Developed methods to crosswalk from one cognitive outcome to another in studies of dementia interventions. Methods illustrated using combinations of global cognitive tests: the CDR-SB, MoCA, and MMSE. Illustrates scenarios where crosswalking may not be appropriate for certain combinations of measures. Crosswalking methods support comparison of interventions with accurate error propagation. Facilitates inclusion of more studies in meta-analyses by increasing data comparability.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
38788775,Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Guidance on Dementia: The Investigation of Suspected Dementia (SIGN 168) with Focus on Biomarkers-Executive Summary.,"This is an executive summary of the recent guidance produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) dementia guideline group with regards to the investigation of suspected dementia. This is a sub-section of the broader SIGN 168 guideline released in November 2023. The guideline group included clinicians with expertise in Old Age Psychiatry, Neurology, Radiology, and Nuclear Medicine supported by colleagues from the SIGN and Healthcare Improvement Scotland teams. There was representation from carers and support organizations with experience of dementia, to ensure the recommendations were appropriate from the perspective of the people being assessed for possible dementia and their carers. As the 2018 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) dementia review included a review of the evidenced investigation of dementia, the SIGN guideline development group decided to focus on a review on the up-to-date evidence regarding the role of imaging and fluid biomarkers in the diagnosis of dementia. To give context to the consideration of more advanced diagnostic biomarker investigations, the guideline and this summary include the NICE guidance on the use of standard investigations as well as more specialist investigations. The evidence review supports consideration of the use of structural imaging, nuclear medicine imaging, and established Alzheimer's cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid and tau) in the diagnosis of dementia. Although routine use of amyloid positron emission tomography imaging was not recommended, its potential use, under specialist direction, in patients with atypical or young-onset presentations of suspected Alzheimer's dementia was included as a clinical good practice point.",Thrombosis and haemostasis
39936232,Remote cognitive tests predict neurodegenerative biomarkers in the Insight 46 cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers detect pathology years before symptoms emerge, when disease-modifying therapies might be most beneficial. Remote cognitive testing provides a means of assessing early cognitive changes. We explored the relationship between neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognition in cognitively normal individuals. METHODS: We remotely deployed 13 computerized Cognitron tasks in 255 Insight 46 participants. We generated amyloid load and positivity, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), whole brain and hippocampal volumes at age 73, plus rates of change over 2 years. We examined the relationship between Cognitron, biomarkers, and standard neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Slower response time on a delayed recognition task predicted amyloid positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.95), and WMHV (1.23, CI: 1.00, 1.56). Brain and hippocampal atrophy rates correlated with poorer visuospatial performance (b = -0.42, CI: -0.80, -0.05) and accuracy on immediate recognition (b = -0.01, CI: -0.012, -0.001), respectively. Standard tests correlated with Cognitron composites (rho = 0.50, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Remote computerized testing correlates with standard supervised assessments and holds potential for studying early cognitive changes associated with neurodegeneration. HIGHLIGHTS: 70% of the Online 46 cohort performed a set of remote online cognitive tasks. Response time and accuracy on a memory task predicted amyloid status and load (SUVR). Accuracy on memory and spatial span tasks correlated with longitudinal atrophy rate. The Cognitron tasks correlated with standard supervised cognitive tests. Online cognitive testing can help identify early AD-related memory deficits.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39789614,Plasma S100β is a predictor for pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier dysfunction is one characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is recognized as both a cause and consequence of the pathological cascade leading to cognitive decline. The goal of this study was to assess markers for barrier dysfunction in postmortem tissue samples from research participants who were either cognitively normal individuals (CNI) or diagnosed with AD at the time of autopsy and determine to what extent these markers are associated with AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and cognitive impairment. METHODS: We used postmortem brain tissue and plasma samples from 19 participants: 9 CNI and 10 AD dementia patients who had come to autopsy from the University of Kentucky AD Research Center (UK-ADRC) community-based cohort; all cases with dementia had confirmed severe ADNC. Plasma samples were obtained within 2 years of autopsy. Aβ40, Aβ42, and tau levels in brain tissue samples were quantified by ELISA. Cortical brain sections were cleared using the X-CLARITY(™) system and immunostained for neurovascular unit-related proteins. Brain slices were then imaged using confocal microscopy and analyzed for microvascular diameters and immunoreactivity coverage using Fiji/ImageJ. Isolated human brain microvessels were assayed for tight-junction protein expression using the JESS™ automated Western blot system. S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100β), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in plasma were quantified by ELISA. All outcomes were assessed for linear associations with global cognitive function (MMSE, CDR) and cerebral atrophy scores by Pearson, polyserial, or polychoric correlation, as appropriate, along with generalized linear modeling or generalized linear mixed-level modeling. RESULTS: As expected, we detected elevated Aβ and tau pathology in brain tissue sections from AD patients compared to CNI. However, we found no differences in microvascular diameters in cleared AD and CNI brain tissue sections. We also observed no differences in claudin-5 protein levels in capillaries isolated from AD and CNI tissue samples. Plasma biomarker analysis showed that AD patients had 12.4-fold higher S100β plasma levels, twofold lower NSE plasma levels, 2.4-fold higher MMP-9 plasma levels, and 1.2-fold lower MMP-2 plasma levels than CNI. Data analysis revealed that elevated S100β plasma levels were predictive of AD pathology and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that among different markers relevant to barrier dysfunction, plasma S100β is the most promising diagnostic biomarker for ADNC. Further investigation is necessary to assess how plasma S100β levels relate to these changes and whether they may predict clinical outcomes, particularly in the prodromal and early stages of AD.",Fluids and barriers of the CNS

39710907,Retinal Microstructural and Microvascular Changes in Alzheimer Disease: A Review.,"""The eyes are a window to the brain,"" prompting the investigation of whether retinal biomarkers can indicate Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. AD is a neurodegenerative condition with a lengthy preclinical phase where pathologic changes in the central nervous system (CNS) occur before clinical symptoms. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often precedes AD. As part of the CNS, the retina exhibits similar pathologic changes related to AD as those seen in the brains of patients with MCI. Noninvasive imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) allow high-resolution visualization of the retina, providing an opportunity to screen and monitor AD noninvasively. In this review, we summarize the relationship between AD and retinal pathology detected by OCT and OCTA. The most common findings in patients with AD include peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, decreased macular thickness, an enlarged foveal avascular zone, and decreased vascular densities in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses. These retinal changes correlate with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of cerebral atrophy, positron emission tomography (PET) findings of increased amyloid load, and neuropsychological testing results suggesting cognitive dysfunction. We conclude that retinal microstructural and microvascular abnormalities may serve as biomarkers for the early detection and clinical monitoring of AD and as tools for evaluating potential treatment effects. Future studies should focus on standardizing protocols for in vivo ophthalmic imaging to measure retinal pathology in AD and MCI.",International ophthalmology clinics
39825890,"Comparison of the amyloid plaque proteome in Down syndrome, early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.","Down syndrome (DS) is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to APP overexpression, exhibiting Amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau pathology similar to early-onset (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). We evaluated the Aβ plaque proteome of DS, EOAD, and LOAD using unbiased localized proteomics on post-mortem paraffin-embedded tissues from four cohorts (n = 20/group): DS (59.8 ± 4.99 y/o), EOAD (63 ± 4.07 y/o), LOAD (82.1 ± 6.37 y/o), and controls (66.4 ± 13.04). We identified differentially abundant proteins when comparing Aβ plaques and neighboring non-plaque tissue (FDR < 5%, fold-change > 1.5) in DS (n = 132), EOAD (n = 192), and LOAD (n = 128), with 43 plaque-associated proteins shared across all groups. Positive correlations were observed between plaque-associated proteins in DS and EOAD (R(2) = .77), DS and LOAD (R(2) = .73), and EOAD and LOAD (R(2) = .67). Top gene ontology biological processes (GOBP) included lysosomal transport (p = 1.29 × 10(-5)) for DS, immune system regulation (p = 4.33 × 10(-5)) for EOAD, and lysosome organization (p = 0.029) for LOAD. Protein networks revealed a plaque-associated protein signature involving APP metabolism, immune response, and lysosomal functions. In DS, EOAD, and LOAD non-plaque vs. control tissue, we identified 263, 269, and 301 differentially abundant proteins, with 65 altered proteins shared across all cohorts. Non-plaque proteins in DS showed modest correlations with EOAD (R(2) = .59) and LOAD (R(2) = .33) compared to the correlation between EOAD and LOAD (R(2) = .79). Top GOBP term for all groups was chromatin remodeling (p < 0.001), with additional terms for DS including extracellular matrix, and protein-DNA complexes and gene expression regulation for EOAD and LOAD. Our study reveals key functional characteristics of the amyloid plaque proteome in DS, compared to EOAD and LOAD, highlighting shared pathways in endo/lysosomal functions and immune responses.

39935389,Influence of alpha-synuclein on glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease continuum: Analyses of α-synuclein seed amplification assay and FDG-PET.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the association between alpha-synuclein (α-syn) pathology and brain glucose metabolism across the cognitive spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathologies. METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data from 829 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (648 cognitively impaired [CI], 181 unimpaired [CU]) were compared between α-syn seed amplification assay (SAA) positive and negative groups. Interactions with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers were examined. RESULTS: SAA+ was associated with widespread hypometabolism among CI individuals, particularly in posterior cortical regions, independent of CSF amyloid and tau levels in the occipital lobes. Regional hypometabolism mediated the effect of α-syn SAA on disease severity in CI individuals, independent of CSF amyloid and tau levels. There were no influences of SAA on FDG-PET in CU individuals. DISCUSSION: This study supports a model in which α-syn aggregation influences metabolic dysfunction, which then influences clinical disease severity, independent of AD. SAA+ could help optimize participant selection and outcome measures for clinical trials in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: α-synuclein seed amplification positivity (SAA+) was associated with hypometabolism in cognitively impaired individuals. Hypometabolism mediated the influence of α-synuclein on disease severity. Occipital hypometabolism in SAA+ was independent of cerebrospinal fluid levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology. These findings can optimize future clinical trials targeting α-synuclein pathology.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39799469,Preliminary Evidence for Perturbation-Based tACS-EEG Biomarkers of Gamma Activity in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by impaired inhibitory circuitry and GABAergic dysfunction, which is associated with reduced fast brain oscillations in the gamma band (γ, 30-90 Hz) in several animal models. Investigating such activity in human patients could lead to the identification of novel biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic value. The current study aimed to test a multimodal ""Perturbation-based"" transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation-Electroencephalography (tACS)-EEG protocol to detect how responses to tACS in AD patients correlate with patients' clinical phenotype. METHODS: Fourteen participants with mild to moderate dementia due to AD underwent a baseline assessment including cognitive status, peripheral neuroinflammation, and resting-state (rs)EEG. The tACS-EEG recordings included brief (6') tACS blocks of gamma (i.e., 40 Hz) stimulation administered through 4 different montages, with Pre/Post 32-Channels EEG for each block. Changes in tACS-EEG and rsEEG γ band power with respect to baseline were adopted as a metric of induction and compared with cognitive scores and neuroinflammatory biomarkers. RESULTS: We found positive correlations between 40 Hz-induced γ activity in fronto-central-parietal areas and patient cognitive status and negative ones with neuroinflammatory markers. Participants with greater cognitive impairment exhibited less γ induction and higher peripheral neuroinflammation. The same analysis performed with spectral power from baseline rsEEG resulted in no significant correlations, promoting the value of tACS-based perturbation for capturing individual differences in pathology-related brain features. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests a link between tACS-induced γ band spectral power and clinical severity, with weaker γ induction corresponding to more severe clinical/cognitive impairment. This study provides preliminary support for the development of novel physiological biomarkers and therapeutic targets based on disease severity.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry
39849125,Accuracy and clinical applicability of plasma tau 181 and 217 for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in a memory clinic cohort.,"Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and 217 (p-tau217) have demonstrated high accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, defined by CSF/PET amyloid beta (Aβ) positivity, but most studies have been performed in research cohorts, limiting their generalizability. We studied plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 for CSF Aβ status discrimination in a cohort of consecutive patients attending an academic memory clinic in Spain (July 2019-June 2024). All patients had CSF AD biomarkers performed as part of their routine clinical assessment. Aβ positivity was defined with a local cut-off of CSF Aβ(1-42) < 600 pg/mL; in patients with borderline Aβ(1-42) values or when there was a mismatch between the Aβ and the T status (T + if CSF p-tau181 ≥ 65 pg/mL), a ratio Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40) < 0.07 was used. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 were measured retrospectively, from blood samples collected at first visit, with Fujirebio Lumipulse and Quanterix Simoa assays, respectively. We included 468 patients (mean age 67 years, 50% female, 61% Aβ positive). Plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 in discriminating CSF Aβ status (AUC 0.95 vs 0.90, p = 0.005). A 97.5% sensitivity and specificity plasma p-tau217 algorithm, classifying patients into three groups of Aβ probability (Low, Intermediate and High), resulted in 67% of patients in the Low and High groups, having their Aβ status predicted (as negative and positive, respectively) with 96% accuracy. The remaining 33% in the Intermediate group were candidates to undergo CSF/PET testing. A model with a 10% variation in p-tau217 levels yielded small changes in accuracy (95%). In conclusion, plasma p-tau217 could have discriminated CSF Aβ status in two-thirds of patients with very high accuracy in a memory clinic cohort. These results support the implementation of plasma p-tau217 as an initial diagnostic tool in memory clinics for AD diagnosis, reducing the need for more invasive/expensive testing.",Journal of neurology
40299731,Classification of Neuropsychiatric Disorders via Brain-Region-Selected Graph Convolutional Network.,"For the classification of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders based on rs-fMRI data, this paper proposed a Brain-Region-Selected graph convolutional network (BRS-GCN). In order to effectively identify the most significant biomarkers associated with disease, we designed a novel ROI pooling score function. Additionally, we also designed a comprehensive loss function, including a group-level consistency loss function for preserving the same brain regions in subjects of the same category, and an anti-consistency function for maximizing brain region preservation differences between subjects of different categories. On the basis of the ROI graph, we directly incorporate the non-imaging information of the subjects in the network training. Experimental results on two public datasets, ABIDE and ADNI, validate the superiority of the model proposed in this paper, and the qualitative results of the biomarkers demonstrate the potential application of the model in medical diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a
39713875,Plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) is sensitive to early cerebral amyloid accumulation and predicts risk of cognitive decline across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.,"INTRODUCTION: The availability of amyloid beta (Aβ) targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing the demand for scalable biomarkers that are sensitive to early cerebral Aβ accumulation. METHODS: We evaluated fully-automated Lumipulse plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) immunoassays for detecting cerebral Aβ in 457 clinically unimpaired (CU) and clinically impaired (CI) Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Stanford ADRC) participants and 186 CU in the Stanford Aging and Memory Study (SAMS). Longitudinal change in ADRC plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) and cognition and cross-sectional associations with SAMS memory and tau positron emission tomography (PET) were examined. RESULTS: Plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) exhibited high performance in detecting amyloid positivity defined by PET (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.885, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.816-0.955). Once abnomal, plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) remained low and predicted cognitive decline in both CU and CI individuals. Among SAMS CU, plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) was associated with poorer hippocampal-dependent memory and elevated tau accumulation. DISCUSSION: Lumipulse plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) is a scalable assay for detection of cerebral Aβ and prediction of risk for cognitive decline across the AD continuum. HIGHLIGHTS: Lumipulse plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)(42)/Aβ(40) exhibited high accuracy in detecting amyloid positivity. Plasma amyloid-positive (Aβ+) individuals exhibited stability of Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) over time. Plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) predicted future cognitive decline across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. Plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) was sensitive to memory and tau burden in clinically unimpaired older adults.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39278307,The role of lipid species in Alzheimer's disease onset: A comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge, with its etiology intricately linked to a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Among these, lipid metabolism has been hypothesized to play a crucial role, though the causal pathways remain inadequately elucidated. This study aims to employ Mendelian Randomization (MR) to unravel the potential causal relationships between a comprehensive array of lipid species and the risk of developing AD. METHODS: Utilizing a two-sample MR framework, we analyzed data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) encompassing 487,511 individuals of European descent. A total of 179 lipid species across 13 lipid categories were investigated for their causal association with AD. Genetic variants serving as instrumental variables (IVs) were carefully selected based on stringent criteria to ensure validity. The statistical analyses, including inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median-based estimation, and sensitivity analyses, were conducted using the R software environment. RESULTS: Our findings reveal a significant causal relationship between ten specific lipid species and the risk of AD. Notably, certain lipids such as Sterol ester (27:1/15:0) and Phosphatidylcholine (16:0_22:4) exhibited a protective effect against AD, as evidenced by their inverse correlation with the disease's risk. Additionally, a reciprocal analysis suggested a negative causal impact of AD on the levels of certain Triacylglycerol species. The integrity of our results was reinforced by sensitivity analyses, including the MR Egger intercept test, indicating the absence of horizontal pleiotropy and confirming the reliability of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study substantiates the causal link between specific lipid species and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the complex interplay between lipid metabolism and AD pathogenesis. The identified lipid biomarkers offer new insights into the disease's etiology and potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our rigorous methodological approach demonstrates the utility of MR in disentangling the causal relationships in complex diseases.",Brain research
39625110,Tau pathway-based gene analysis on PET identifies CLU and FYN in a Korean cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: The influence of genetic variation on tau protein aggregation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains not fully understood. We aimed to identify novel genes associated with brain tau deposition using pathway-based candidate gene association analysis in a Korean cohort. METHODS: We analyzed data for 146 older adults from the well-established Korean AD continuum cohort (Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease; KBASE). Fifteen candidate genes related to both tau pathways and AD were selected. Association analyses were performed using PLINK: A tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses (PLINK) on tau deposition measured by (18)F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET) scans, with additional voxel-wise analysis conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12). RESULTS: CLU and FYN were significantly associated with tau deposition, with the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being rs149413552 and rs57650567, respectively. These SNPs were linked to increased tau across key brain regions and showed additive effects with apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4. DISCUSSION: CLU and FYN may play specific roles in tau pathophysiology, offering potential targets for biomarkers and therapies. HIGHLIGHTS: Gene-based analysis identified CLU and FYN as associated with tau deposition on positron emission tomography (PET). CLU rs149413552 and FYN rs57650567 were associated with brain tau deposition. rs149413552 and rs57650567 were associated with structural brain atrophy. CLU rs149413552 was associated with immediate verbal memory. CLU and FYN may play specific roles in tau pathophysiology.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39946349,Characterizing plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers relevant to neurodegeneration in captive olive baboons (Papio anubis).,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a significant global disease burden that is only expected to grow in the future. As such, there is a need to develop and investigate biomarkers that identify individuals at risk of developing ADRD with the goal of providing early interventions and treatments. Non-human primate (NHP) models of neurodegeneration present opportunities to examine such biomarkers in a preclinical model with the ability to control several confounding factors present in research with humans. Baboons naturally develop several ADRD-related neuropathologies that humans also exhibit, including age-related tau and amyloid deposition. However, to our knowledge, there are no data characterizing fluid biomarkers relevant to neurodegeneration or ADRD in baboons. We collected plasma (N = 139) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, N = 44) from captive baboons ranging in age from 3-19 years old. We characterized biomarkers as a function of age, sex, and rearing status in baboons using a bead-based bioplex human assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific's Neuroscience 18-Plex Human ProcartaPlex™ Panel). Fluid biomarkers were more detectable in CSF compared to plasma. Additionally, while sex and rearing did not significantly predict biomarkers in baboons, age significantly predicted levels of eight of the 12 biomarkers detected in the assay. Linear regressions showed that CSF levels of total tau, pTau181, NGF-beta, GFAP, NF-H, and S100B were higher in older baboons, as were plasma levels of NGF-beta. Lastly, older baboons showed a higher incidence of co-occurrence of multiple biomarkers as measured in CSF, but not in plasma. These data show that baboons exhibit age-dependent changes in biomarkers used in humans for clinical screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of ADRD, thereby further demonstrating the value of baboons as a model of aging and, possibly, ADRD.",PloS one
39821434,Neuropsychiatric symptoms and neuroimaging-based brain age in mild cognitive impairment and early dementia: A multicenter study.,"AIM: Despite the clinical importance and significant social burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, the underlying neurobiological mechanism remains poorly understood. Recently, neuroimaging-derived brain-age estimation by machine-learning analysis has shown promise as an individual-level biomarker. We investigated the relationship between NPS and brain-age in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, clinical data, including neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), and structural brain MRI of 499 individuals with clinical diagnoses of amnestic MCI (n = 185), early Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 258) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 56) were analyzed. We established a brain-age prediction model using 694 healthy brain MRIs and a support vector regression model and applied it to the participants' data. Finally, the brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD: predicted age minus chronological age) was calculated. RESULTS: All groups showed significantly increased brain-PAD, and the median (IQR) brain-PAD was 4.3 (5.4) years in MCI, 6.3 (6.2) years in AD, and 5.0 (6.5) years in DLB. The NPI scores were subdivided into the following four categories: (i) Agitation and Irritability, (ii) Depression and Apathy, (iii) Delusions and Hallucinations, and (iv) Euphoria and Disinhibition. We found a significantly positive correlation between brain-PAD and the depression/apathy factor (Spearman's rs = 0.156, FDR-corrected P = 0.002), whereas no significance was shown for the other NPS factors. CONCLUSION: Higher brain-age may be associated with depression and apathy symptoms presented in MCI to early dementia stages, and brain-age analysis may be useful as a novel biomarker for the assessment or monitoring of NPS.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences
39907291,"Grey-Matter Structure Markers of Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's Conversion, Functioning and Cognition: A Meta-Analysis Across 11 Cohorts.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain markers are needed to select people with early-stage AD for clinical trials and as quantitative endpoint measures in trials. Using 10 clinical cohorts (N = 9140) and the community volunteer UK Biobank (N = 37,664) we performed region of interest (ROI) and vertex-wise analyses of grey-matter structure (thickness, surface area and volume). We identified 94 trait-ROI significant associations, and 307 distinct cluster of vertex-associations, which partly overlap the ROI associations. For AD versus controls, smaller hippocampus, amygdala and of the medial temporal lobe (fusiform and parahippocampal gyri) was confirmed and the vertex-wise results provided unprecedented localisation of some of the associated region. We replicated AD associated differences in several subcortical (putamen, accumbens) and cortical regions (inferior parietal, postcentral, middle temporal, transverse temporal, inferior temporal, paracentral, superior frontal). These grey-matter regions and their relative effect sizes can help refine our understanding of the brain regions that may drive or precede the widespread brain atrophy observed in AD. An AD grey-matter score evaluated in independent cohorts was significantly associated with cognition, MCI status, AD conversion (progression from cognitively normal or MCI to AD), genetic risk, and tau concentration in individuals with none or mild cognitive impairments (AUC in 0.54-0.70, p-value < 5e-4). In addition, some of the grey-matter regions associated with cognitive impairment, progression to AD ('conversion'), and cognition/functional scores were also associated with AD, which sheds light on the grey-matter markers of disease stages, and their relationship with cognitive or functional impairment. Our multi-cohort approach provides robust and fine-grained maps the grey-matter structures associated with AD, symptoms, and progression, and calls for even larger initiatives to unveil the full complexity of grey-matter structure in AD.",Human brain mapping
39747866,Immunoassay detection of multiphosphorylated tau proteoforms as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 (p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (discovery n = 55, validation n = 118). CSF and plasma p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 and CSF, but not plasma, p-tau181&231 were significantly elevated in all AD continuum groups vs. Neurological Disease Control group. Notably, plasma p-tau217&231 consistently showed an improved diagnostic performance compared with single-site phosphorylation assays - p-tau217 or p-tau231. The differences observed between CSF and plasma measurements suggest matrix-specific protein processing, underscoring the need for further research on the dynamics of tau phosphorylation pattern along the AD continuum.",Nature communications
39686618,Associations between antidiabetic medications and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance is pivotal in mediating amyloid and tau dysregulations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of different antidiabetic agents, their daily dosage intake, and treatment duration on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers among patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study selected patients between 50 and 80 years with diabetes and CSF AD biomarkers screened between 2017 and 2023 in the VALCODIS Cohort. CSF biomarkers were total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau), and amyloid-β 42 (Aβ(42)). Analytical variables were obtained. Antidiabetic prescriptions were recorded in defined daily doses (DDD), according to the ATC/DDD 2021 system, and years of drug exposure duration before lumbar puncture. Logistic regressions were performed to establish the correlations between drug usage and AD biomarker alteration. RESULTS: Among patients with diabetes, Insulin consumption was associated with lower odds of abnormal Aβ(42) levels (OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.15, 0.76]) and tau pathology (OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.24-0.98]). Metformin was related to lower odds of pathological p-tau when diabetes was uncontrolled, acting on t-tau and t-tau/Aβ(42) ratio when it was concomitant with insulin, and patients had controlled diabetes. Lower odds of pathological levels of tau were observed when additional oral antidiabetic drugs were added among metformin users. iSGLT2 was associated with tau pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of antidiabetics on AD-related pathological biomarkers may depend on diabetes management.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39864928,Sleep-wake modulation and pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease: Suggestions for postponement and treatment.,"Sleep-wake disorders are recognized as one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Accumulating evidence has highlighted a significant association between sleep-wake disorders and AD pathogenesis, suggesting that sleep-wake modulation could be a promising approach for postponing AD onset. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the pineal hormone melatonin are major central modulating components of the circadian rhythm system. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) melatonin levels are dramatically decreased in AD. Interestingly, the number of neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus, which is one of the two major neuropathologic AD biomarkers, increases in parallel with the decrease in CSF melatonin levels. Furthermore, a decrease in salivary melatonin levels in middle-aged persons is a significant risk factor for the onset of the early stages of AD. Moreover, the disappearance of rhythmic fluctuations in melatonin may be one of the best biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Light therapy combined with melatonin supplementation is the recommended first-line treatment for sleep-wake disorders in AD patients and may be beneficial for ameliorating cognitive impairment. Sleep-wake cycle modulation based on AD risk gene presence is a promising early intervention for AD onset postponement.",Handbook of clinical neurology
39855473,Longitudinally persisting KCNA2-autoantibodies in mild amnestic dementia with Alzheimer´s pathology - Report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Neural autoantibodies are being increasingly detected in conjunction with neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), yet their significance is not well clarified. In this case report, we report the previously unreported long-lasting persistence of potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 2 (KCNA2) antibodies in biomarker-supported AD. METHODS: We report on a 77-year-old, male patient evaluated in our outpatient memory clinic of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Göttingen. Neuropsychological test results and autoantibody testing in serum over a period of 4-5 years is provided. REPORT: Our patient exhibited mild dementia syndrome and was diagnosed with AD on the basis of a prototypical biomarker profile (reduced Aβ42/40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 protein in cerebrospinal fluid). Within a 5-year follow-up with regular visits to our memory clinic, we observed a nearly stable neuropsychological profile of mild, amnestic variant dementia that did not noticeably progress. KCNA2 autoantibodies were also detectable in serum over 4 years with increasing titers over time. Combined anti-dementia therapy with donepezil, multimodal therapy including non-pharmacological cognitive therapy, and immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone was carried out as an individual treatment approach. CONCLUSIONS: KCNA2 autoantibody persistence in biomarker-supported AD does not necessarily trigger a poor outcome in the long-term, as cognitive impairment did not progress subsequently. At the same time, mild immunotherapy did not result in less immunoreactivity in conjunction with the detection of KCNA2 autoantibodies. This detection of KCNA2 autoantibodies in AD could provide indices of a potentially benign long-term AD course that should be further evaluated in studies.",Behavioural brain research
38478432,Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in the Preclinical Stage: Normal Aging or Dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) progressively impairs the memory and thinking skills of patients, resulting in a significant global economic and social burden each year. However, diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disorder can be challenging, particularly in the early stages of developing cognitive decline. Current clinical techniques are expensive, laborious, and invasive, which hinders comprehensive studies on Alzheimer's biomarkers and the development of efficient devices for Point-of-Care testing (POCT) applications. To address these limitations, researchers have been investigating various biosensing techniques. Unfortunately, these methods have not been commercialized due to several drawbacks, such as low efficiency, reproducibility, and the lack of accurate identification of AD markers. In this review, we present diverse promising hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease identified in various biofluids and body behaviors. Additionally, we thoroughly discuss different biosensing mechanisms and the associated challenges in disease diagnosis. In each context, we highlight the potential of realizing new biosensors to study various features of the disease, facilitating its early diagnosis in POCT. This comprehensive study, focusing on recent efforts for different aspects of the disease and representing promising opportunities, aims to conduct the future trend toward developing a new generation of compact multipurpose devices that can address the challenges in the early detection of AD.",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering
40009569,Perspective: Emerging challenges for a future ADNI.,"In the last two decades, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has significantly advanced our understanding, technologies, and methods for detecting and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

39715476,Comparison of Plasma p-tau217 and [(18)F]FDG-PET for Identifying Alzheimer Disease in People With Early-Onset or Atypical Dementia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic performance of an immunoassay for plasma concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 with visual assessments of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose [(18)F]FDG-PET in individuals who meet appropriate use criteria for Alzheimer dementia (AD) biomarker assessments. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals with early-onset (age <65 years at onset) and/or atypical dementia (features other than memory at onset), who were evaluated at a tertiary care memory clinic. All participants underwent measurements of CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau181, and total tau levels), as well as [(18)F]FDG-PET scans, amyloid-PET scans, and plasma p-tau217 quantifications. To determine whether the [(18)F]FDG-PET images were compatible with AD, images were visually rated by 2 nuclear medicine experts. Using a contingency analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of [(18)F]FDG-PET scan interpretation and plasma p-tau217 for an AD biomarker profile in CSF and for amyloid-PET positivity. RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals with early onset and/or atypical dementia were included in this study (mean age = 65 years; 48/81 female (59%). Both [(18)F]FDG-PET and plasma p-tau217 showed high levels of agreement with reference standard AD biomarkers ([(18)F]FDG-PET area under the curve [AUC]: 71%; plasma p-tau217 AUC: 81%). Although both biomarkers had similar specificity for AD [(18)F]FDG-PET: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81; plasma p-tau217: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81), plasma p-tau217 had higher sensitivity for AD (plasma p-tau217: 97%, CI: 0.85-0.99 vs [(18)F]FDG-PET: 73%, CI: 0.57-0.85) (p = 0.01). Overall accuracy was also higher for plasma p-tau217 (AUC = 84%, CI: 0.75-0.93 vs 72%, CI: 0.60-0.83 of [(18)F]FDG-PET) (p = 0.02). The same pattern of results was observed when using amyloid-PET as the reference standard. DISCUSSION: Our study provides evidence that plasma p-tau217 has strong discriminative accuracy for AD among patients with early-onset and/or atypical dementia assessed in specialized settings. Future work should replicate these findings in secondary care settings.",Neurology
40420450,[A comprehensive study of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine, evaluate, and analyze the diagnostic value of various laboratory biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The concentrations of 93 potential biomarkers in plasma and CSF were studied in patients with AD at various stages (n=53) and independently in the group at the predementia stage (n=15). RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations of various directions (p≤0.05) were found between the coefficients characterizing the amyloidosis and neurodegeneration (Aβ-42/Aβ-40, phTau181/Aβ-42, phTau181/oTau, oTau/Aβ-42) with markers associated with neuroinflammation, vascular disorders, angiogenesis, neuroimaging changes, and neuropsychological indicators. Previous studies of markers associated with inflammation in CSF in AD patients have shown mixed results, and no markers have been introduced into clinical practice so far. Many biomarkers associated with two classical pathogenetic links and other pathophysiological processes have been identified. CONCLUSION: Coefficients reflecting two main pathogenetic processes in CSF of AD patients (Aβ-42/Aβ-40, phTau181/Aβ-42, phTau181/oTau, oTau/Aβ-42) are the most informative for verifying two main links in the disease pathogenesis-amyloidogenesis and neurodegeneration. In the group of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), statistically significant relationships of cytokines associated with neuroinflammation, growth factors, and complement system protein with coefficients of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration in CSF, as well as PET, MRI, and neuropsychological tests were shown; therefore, these indicators can also be considered as potential diagnostic biomarkers of early stages and possible predictors of MCI conversion to dementia. Such markers as GFAP, apolipoprotein A1, GDF-15, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, VEGF, and complement C3 should be considered as objects for further research as biomarkers for early diagnosis.",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

40336943,Neural correlates of subjective cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review of structural and functional brain changes for early diagnosis and intervention.,"BACKGROUND: Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is increasingly recognized as a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing a critical window for early detection and intervention. Understanding the structural and functional neural changes in SCD can improve diagnosis, monitoring, and management of this early stage of disease. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to identify studies examining neuroanatomical, neurofunctional, and neuroimaging findings in individuals with SCD. Inclusion criteria emphasized studies exploring SCD's potential as an early biomarker for AD progression. RESULTS: A total of 2.283 studies were screened, with 17 meeting the inclusion criteria. Evidence indicates that SCD is associated with cortical thinning and reductions in gray matter volume (GMV), particularly in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and medial temporal lobe. Functional imaging studies reveal disruptions in the default mode network (DMN), executive control networks (ECN), and sensorimotor networks (SMN), indicating both compensatory mechanisms and early dysfunction. Dynamic functional connectivity studies report reduced brain activity efficiency, while graph theory analyses show decreased network integration. Advanced neuroimaging techniques and machine learning (ML) approaches demonstrate significant promise in detecting subtle neural changes in SCD, with applications for early diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. CONCLUSION: SCD represents a heterogeneous condition characterized by mixed compensatory and degenerative neural changes, marking a critical early stage in the AD continuum. Combining structural and functional brain alterations with advanced neuroimaging and ML methodologies provides valuable biomarkers for early detection. Future longitudinal and multimodal studies are essential to standardize methodologies, account for individual variability, and develop personalized interventions aimed at mitigating progression to dementia.

40340070,The dependence of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons on NGF: The case in Alzheimer pathology.,"This chapter discusses the dependency of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) on endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) for the structural and physiologic maintenance of the neuronal cell somata, axonal projections, and terminal synapses. It covers the discovery of NGF and the occurrence of a CNS neurotrophin family and their cognate receptors and their signaling mechanisms. It concludes with a description of the NGF metabolic pathway and its dysregulation in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Down syndrome pathology, explaining the progressive atrophy of BFCNs, which starts at preclinical stages and is reflected in body fluid biomarkers.",Handbook of clinical neurology
40382133,Measurements of acrolein adducts resulting from polyamine catabolism.,"Acrolein (CH(2)=CH-CHO) is an unsaturated aldehyde, produced primarily from spermine [NH(2)(CH(2))(3)NH(CH(2))(4)NH(CH(2))(3)NH(2)] by spermine oxidase (SMOX), and shows high reactivity with protein cysteine- and lysine-residues to produce protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro) or amino acid-conjugated acrolein (AC-Acro). Increase in PC-Acro in plasma has been identified as a biomarker for stroke, silent brain infarction (SBI) and dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, decrease in AC-Acro and taurine in urine was observed in dementia. In addition, properties of proteins such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and cytoskeleton proteins are altered by conjugation with acrolein.",Methods in enzymology
39836215,Association of objective subtle cognitive difficulties with amyloid-β and tau deposition compared to subjective cognitive decline.,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the differences in amyloid-β (Aβ), tau deposition, and longitudinal tau deposition between subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and objective subtle cognitive difficulties (Obj-SCD). METHODS: Participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n = 234) and the Huashan cohort (n = 267) included individuals with Obj-SCD, SCD, subjective memory concern (SMC), and healthy controls (HC). General linear models (GLM) were used to compare baseline and longitudinal differences in Aβ and tau among the groups, and to examine the associations between these biomarkers. RESULTS: Obj-SCD participants had significantly higher Aβ and tau levels compared to HC, with increased annual accumulation of Aβ and tau, especially in Braak stages III-IV. In contrast, SCD/SMC participants did not show significant differences from HC in annual Aβ and tau changes. Baseline Aβ PET correlated with annual tau PET changes in Obj-SCD (Braak III-VI) and SCD/SMC (all Braak stages), and baseline Aβ levels strongly predicted early memory decline in both Obj-SCD and SCD/SMC groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that Obj-SCD is more strongly associated with Aβ and tau biomarkers, with Aβ contributing to the progression of tau pathology and memory decline. Further research should include more longitudinal data to more robustly validate these findings and clarify the temporal relationship between Aβ and tau in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging
39868480,Malnutrition exacerbating neuropsychiatric symptoms on the Alzheimer's continuum is relevant to the cAMP signaling pathway: Human and mouse studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition correlates with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the potential mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. METHODS: Baseline and longitudinal associations of nutritional status with NPSs were analyzed in 374 patients on the AD continuum and 61 healthy controls. Serum biomarkers, behavioral tests, cerebral neurotransmitters, and differentially gene expression were evaluated in standard and malnourished diet-fed transgenic APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. RESULTS: Poor nutritional status and increased cerebral blood flow in the midbrain and striatum were associated with severe general NPSs and subtypes, especially depression, anxiety, and apathy. APP/PS1 mice fed a malnourished diet showed poor nutritional status, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, altered neurotransmitter levels, and downregulated c-Fos expression in the midbrain and striatum; these were associated with suppressed cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. DISCUSSION: Malnutrition exacerbating NPSs is relevant to suppressed cAMP pathway in the midbrain and striatum, suggesting the potential for targeted nutritional interventions to mitigate NPSs in the AD continuum. HIGHLIGHTS: Poor nutritional status linked to general and specific neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) deterioration. Malnutrition affects NPSs, usually involving the midbrain and striatum. Malnourished diet induces depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Malnutrition exacerbates NPSs associated with cAMP signaling pathway in the midbrain and striatum.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39791192,Effect of serum uric acid to creatinine ratio on cognitive function decline in middle-aged adults: Longitudinal evidence from CHARLS.,"BACKGROUND: Serum uric acid (SUA) was a predictor of cognitive function. The association of SUA/serum creatinine ratio (Scr), which represents renal function-normalized SUA and cognitive function is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association of the SUA/Scr with cognitive function and the potential mediation effect of inflammation in the above relationship. METHODS: This study used 1-5 waves of data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. 3302 participants aged 45-60 years at baseline were included. Among them, 1129 who attended subsequent 2-3 waves were further included for cumulative exposure calculation to the SUA/Scr ratio. The Cox models were used to evaluate the impact of baseline SUA/Scr ratio and its cumulative exposure on cognitive function decline. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, there were 1512 (45.8%) cognitive function declined. After adjustment, the highest quartile of the SUA/SCr ratio was associated with the highest risk of cognitive function decline (Hazard ratio, 1.175; 95% confidence interval, 1.015-1.360). Restricted cubic spline showed a linear association between the SUA/Scr ratio and the risk of cognitive function decline (p(non-linear )= 0.514). There were a stronger association of cumulative SUA/Scr ratio and its exposure burden with cognitive function decline [the highest versus lowest quartile: 1.635 (1.006-2.656), the high versus low group: 1.729 (1.212-2.466), respectively]. No significant mediating effect through white blood cell count or C-reactive protein in SUA/Scr ratio-cognitive function decline was found. CONCLUSIONS: The SUA/Scr ratio was associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline, whereas the mechanism mediated by inflammation indicators was not found.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39988952,Evaluation of two plasma-based proteotyping assays against APOE ε4 genotyping in a memory clinic setting: The Gothenburg H70 Clinical Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele status is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and should be determined prior to initiation of anti-amyloid beta antibody treatment, because of increased risk of treatment-related side effects. Plasma-based apoE4 proteotyping may be an alternative to genotyping, with limited clinical evidence. METHODS: apoE4 proteotyping was performed on 164 memory-clinic patients, using one chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and one nucleic acid-linked immunosandwich assay (NULISA). The assays were evaluated against APOE ε4 blood genotyping. RESULTS: The CLEIA had a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify APOE ε4 homozygosity and carriership in relation to genotyping. The NULISA had a 92.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity to classify homozygosity and a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify carriership. DISCUSSION: The high performance suggests that the assays may be used as an easily available tool for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step approach. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma-based proteotyping presented good to excellent sensitivity in identifying apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 homozygosity. The negative predictive value was also very good to excellent, allowing us to rule out APOE ε4 homozygosity with high precision. Assays with excellent precision show potential for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step approach.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39485581,Costs of Care in Relation to Alzheimer's Disease Severity in Sweden: A National Registry-Based Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: The advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) has demanded the economic evaluation of such interventions. Resource utilization and cost estimates in early AD and, more specifically, the amyloid-positive population are still lacking. We aimed to provide cost estimates in AD in relation to disease severity and compare these with the control population. We also aimed to provide cost estimates for a subset of the AD population with both clinical diagnosis and amyloid-positive confirmation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal analysis of resource utilization using data from national registries. A cohort from the national Swedish registry for cognitive/dementia disorders (SveDem) includes all clinically diagnosed AD between 2013 and 2020. The study population included 31,951 people with AD and 63,902 age- and sex-matched controls (1:2). The population was followed until death, the end of December 2020, or 2 years from the last clinic visit. Direct medical and social costs were estimated from other national registries. Direct medical costs include costs for medications and inpatient and outpatient clinical visits. Direct social costs include costs for institutionalization, home care, short-term care, support for daytime activities, and housing support. Mean annual costs and 95% confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping, presented in 2021 Swedish Krona (SEK) (1 SEK = 0.117 USD, 1 SEK = 0.0985 EUR in 2021), and disaggregated by AD severity, cost component, sex, age group, and care setting. RESULTS: Mean annual costs for individuals with clinically diagnosed AD were SEK 99,906, SEK 290,972, SEK 479,524, and SEK 795,617 in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild, moderate, and severe AD. The mean annual costs for the population with both clinical diagnosis and amyloid-positive AD confirmation (N = 5610) were SEK 57,625, SEK 179,153, SEK 333,095, and SEK 668,073 in MCI, mild, moderate, and severe AD, respectively. The mean annual costs were higher in institutionalized than non-institutionalized patients, females than males, and older than younger age groups. Inpatient and drug costs were similar in all AD severity stages, but outpatient costs decreased with AD severity. Costs for institutionalization, home care, support for daytime activities, and short-term care increased with AD severity, whereas the cost of housing support decreased with AD severity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study estimating annual costs in people with AD from MCI to severe AD, including those for the amyloid-positive population. The study provides cost estimates by AD severity, cost components, care settings, sex, and age groups, allowing health economic modelers to apply the costs based on different model structures and populations.",PharmacoEconomics
39559898,Marmosets as model systems for the study of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: Substantiation of physiological tau 3R and 4R isoform expression and phosphorylation.,"INTRODUCTION: Marmosets spontaneously develop pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) including amyloid beta plaques. However, tau expression in the marmoset brain has been understudied. METHODS: Isoforms of tau were examined by western blot, mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: 3R and 4R tau isoforms are expressed in marmoset brains at both the transcript and protein levels across ages. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that tau peptides in marmoset corresponded to the 3R and 4R peptides in human brain, with 3R predominating at birth and an ≈40%:60% 3R:4R ratios in adolescents and adults; tau was distributed widely in neurons, with localization in the soma and synaptic regions. Phosphorylation residues were observed on Threonine (Thr) Thr181, Thr217, Thr231, Serine (Ser) Ser202/Thr205, and Ser396/Ser404. DISCUSSION: Our results confirm both 3R and 4R tau isoform expression and phosphorylation residues in the marmoset brain, and emphasize the significance of marmosets with natural expression of AD-related hallmarks as important translational models for AD. Highlights We report comprehensive characterization of tau isoform expression in marmoset brains across the lifespan. 3R and 4R tau isoforms are expressed in marmoset brains at both the transcript and protein levels across ages. These data emphasize the significance of marmosets with natural expression of primate-specific traits that are important for the study of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39179903,Tau PET positivity predicts clinically relevant cognitive decline driven by Alzheimer's disease compared to comorbid cases; proof of concept in the ADNI study.,"β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology is not always coupled with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relevant cognitive decline. We assessed the accuracy of tau PET to identify Aβ(+) individuals who show prospective disease progression. 396 cognitively unimpaired and impaired individuals with baseline Aβ and tau PET and a follow-up of ≥ 2 years were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. The participants were dichotomously grouped based on either clinical conversion (i.e., change of diagnosis) or cognitive deterioration (fast (FDs) vs. slow decliners (SDs)) using data-driven clustering of the individual annual rates of cognitive decline. To assess cognitive decline in individuals with isolated Aβ(+) or absence of both Aβ and tau (T) pathologies, we investigated the prevalence of non-AD comorbidities and FDG PET hypometabolism patterns suggestive of AD. Baseline tau PET uptake was higher in Aβ(+)FDs than in Aβ(-)FD/SDs and Aβ(+)SDs, independently of baseline cognitive status. Baseline tau PET uptake identified MCI Aβ(+) Converters and Aβ(+)FDs with an area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.87 (composite temporal region of interest) respectively, and was linearly related to the annual rate of cognitive decline in Aβ(+) individuals. The T(+) individuals constituted largely a subgroup of those being Aβ(+) and those clustered as FDs. The most common biomarker profiles in FDs (n = 70) were Aβ(+)T(+) (n = 34, 49%) and Aβ(+)T(-) (n = 19, 27%). Baseline Aβ load was higher in Aβ(+)T(+)FDs (M = 83.03 ± 31.42CL) than in Aβ(+)T(-)FDs (M = 63.67 ± 26.75CL) (p-value = 0.038). Depression diagnosis was more prevalent in Aβ(+)T(-)FDs compared to Aβ(+)T(+)FDs (47% vs. 15%, p-value = 0.021), as were FDG PET hypometabolism pattern not suggestive of AD (86% vs. 50%, p-value = 0.039). Our findings suggest that high tau PET uptake is coupled with both Aβ pathology and accelerated cognitive decline. In cases of isolated Aβ(+), cognitive decline may be associated with changes within the AD spectrum in a multi-morbidity context, i.e., mixed AD.",Molecular psychiatry
39800458,"INTERCEPT-AD, a phase 1 study of intravenous sabirnetug in participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Soluble species of multimeric amyloid-beta including globular amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs) and linear amyloid-beta protofibrils are toxic to neurons. Sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, raised against globular species of soluble AβO, that has over 650-fold greater binding affinity for AβOs over monomers and appears to have relatively little binding to amyloid plaque. OBJECTIVES: To assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory measures including target engagement, biomarker effects, and clinical efficacy of sabirnetug in participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD; defined as mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to AD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose first-in-human phase 1 study. SETTING: Fifteen study centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five participants with early symptomatic AD. INTERVENTION: Participants received one infusion of sabirnetug 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or placebo (Part A) or three infusions of sabirnetug 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or placebo (Part B). MEASUREMENTS: Safety, tolerability, serum pharmacokinetics, and central target engagement of single and multiple doses of sabirnetug, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of sabirnetug, and amyloid plaque load, as determined by positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Sabirnetug was generally well tolerated. A larger percentage of participants receiving sabirnetug (56.3%) versus placebo (42.9%) had at least one treatment emergent adverse event, with approximately 29% in each group considered related to study drug. Most events were mild-to-moderate in severity. Of 48 participants given sabirnetug, five developed amyloid related imaging abnormalities - edema/effusion, including one instance that was mildly symptomatic in a participant who had received one dose sabirnetug 60 mg/kg. Notably, none of the six apolipoprotein E Ɛ4 homozygotes who received sabirnetug developed amyloid related imaging abnormalities - edema/effusion or - hemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition. Infusion reactions, such as rash, pain, or erythema, were not frequent (6.3% for sabirnetug versus 0.0% for placebo). Sabirnetug exposure was dose proportional in both serum and CSF. Target engagement, defined as drug bound to AβOs in CSF, was shown to be dose and exposure dependent. Over three months, approximately 25% and 20% reduction in amyloid plaques, respectively, were observed in participants receiving three infusions of sabirnetug 60 mg/kg every four weeks and 25 mg/kg every two weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD study provided safety, tolerability, dosing, and target engagement data that supported the design of the ongoing ALTITUDE-AD study (NCT06335173).",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39914269,Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers associated with neurofilament light levels: A study in HIV disease.,"BACKGROUND: A retrospective study was conducted in people with HIV (PWH) to explore potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers linked to CSF neurofilament light levels (NfL), indicative of neuronal injury. METHODS: A sample of 168 participants was tested, including 43 HIV-negative controls and PWH who were classified into subgroups based on HIV and treatment status. Twenty CSF protein biomarkers were analyzed for their association with CSF NfL concentrations using a linear regression forward selection strategy, adjusted for age and sex. Regression trees were utilized to visualize feature relationships. RESULTS: Age-adjusted average concentrations of CSF NfL ranged from 427 pg/mL (SD = 190) in HIV- participants to 6456 pg/mL (SD = 46,024) in participants with HIV-associated dementia. Significant associations were found between specific biomarkers and CSF NfL levels in different participant subgroups. Noteworthy findings included correlations between CSF t-tau, CSF MCP-1, CSF TNF-α, and albumin ratio with CSF NfL levels in untreated PWH, and CSF IL-21 with CSF NfL in treated, virally suppressed PWH. Association between age and CSF NfL concentrations was a general finding. CONCLUSION: We identified specific CSF biomarkers, including CSF t-tau protein, CSF MCP-1, and CSF TNF-α that associated with CSF NfL concentrations in untreated PWH and CSF IL-21 that associated with CSF NfL in PWH with effective treatment, shedding light on neuroinflammatory processes which may underlie HIV-related neuronal injury and the impact of antiviral therapy. Further investigations are needed to validate if elevated CSF IL-21 concentrations persist during long-term treatment, and if particular drug combinations are optimal for decreasing inflammatory latency.",Journal of neuroimmunology
39675237,Posterior hippocampal sparing in Lewy body disorders with Alzheimer's copathology: An in vivo MRI study.,"BACKGROUND: Lewy body disorders (LBD), encompassing Parkinson disease (PD), PD dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by alpha-synuclein pathology but often are accompanied by Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological change (ADNC). The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a primary locus of tau accumulation and associated neurodegeneration in AD. However, it is unclear the extent to which AD copathology in LBD (LBD/AD+) contributes to MTL-specific patterns of degeneration. We employ a MTL subregional segmentation strategy of T1-weighted (T1w) MRI in biomarker-supported or autopsy-confirmed LBD and LBD/AD+ to investigate the anatomic consequences of co-occurring LBD/AD+ pathology on neurodegeneration. METHODS: We studied 167 individuals with clinical diagnoses of LBD (PD, n = 124 (74.3 %); PDD, n = 11 (6.6 %); DLB, n = 32 (19.2 %)) with available T1w MRI and AD biomarkers or autopsy evidence of ADNC. Individuals were further biologically classified as LBD/AD+ based on hierarchical evidence of ADNC pathology: 1) AD ""intermediate"" or ""high"" by ABC neuropathologic criteria (n = 39 (23.4 %)); 2) positive amyloid PET (n = 2 (1.2 %)); or 3) CSF β-amyloid(1-42) < 185.7 pg/mL n = 126 (75.4 %)). The T1 Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) pipeline was used to compute volume and thickness measurements of MTL subregions in LBD/AD- and LBD/AD+. Linear regression tested the association of AD copathology and subregion volume/thickness, covarying for age and sex, and intracranial volume for volume measurements. Secondary analyses correlated MTL subregional volume/thickness with cognition and neuropathology. RESULTS: LBD/AD+ had decreased volume/thickness compared to LBD/AD- in all MTL subregions except posterior hippocampus. The greatest effect sizes were seen in Brodmann Area 35 (BA35) (Cohen's d = 0.62, p = 0.002, β = 0.107 ± 0.034), and entorhinal cortex (ERC) (Cohen's d = 0.56, p = 0.006, β = 0.088 ± 0.031). Smaller differences were seen in the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) (Cohen's d = 0.5, p = 0.012, β = 0.082 ± 0.033), BA36 (Cohen's d = 0.47, p = 0.021, β = 0.090 ± 0.039) and anterior hippocampus (Cohen's d = 0.45, p = 0.029, β = 111.790 ± 50.595). Verbal memory scores positively correlated with volume/thickness in anterior and posterior hippocampus, BA35, ERC and PHC, while visuospatial memory positively correlated only in BA35. In the subset of participants with autopsy, lower ERC volume was associated with a higher tau load in ERC (adjusted odds ratio 0.013, 95 % CI [0.0002, 0.841], uncorrected p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Relative to LBD/AD-, LBD/AD+ has greater T1w MRI evidence of atrophy in multiple MTL subregions. Atrophy in MTL subregions associates with memory performance and tau pathological load. The observed pattern of atrophy largely follows expectation from AD Braak stages, except for posterior hippocampus. Longitudinal studies are needed to validate the hypothesized spread of neurodegeneration.",NeuroImage. Clinical
39868632,A neuropathology case report of a woman with Down syndrome who remained cognitively stable: Implications for resilience to neuropathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) accumulate Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40. METHODS: We present findings from an individual with DS who remained cognitively stable despite AD neuropathology. Clinical assessments, fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging, and neuropathological examinations were conducted to characterize her condition. RESULTS: Her apolipoprotein E was ε2/ε3 and genome-wide association study data indicated mosaicism. Neuroimaging revealed stable yet elevated amyloid and moderately elevated tau levels, while neuropathology indicated intermediate AD neuropathologic change with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathologies. The participant demonstrated stable cognitive functioning in her 60s, potentially attributed to genetic variations, cognitive resilience, and environmental enrichment. DISCUSSION: These findings emphasize the complexity of AD progression in DS. Further investigation into factors influencing cognitive resilience in individuals with DS is warranted. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive stability in DS could offer insights into resilience to AD neuropathology in people with DS and inform future interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: Findings from clinical assessments, fluid biomarkers, genotyping, neuroimaging, and neuropathological examinations of an individual with Down syndrome (DS) who remained cognitively stable despite Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology are presented. Neuroimaging revealed stable yet elevated amyloid profiles and moderately elevated tau levels, while neuropathology indicated intermediate AD neuropathologic change with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathologies. Despite the presence of AD pathology, the participant demonstrated intact cognitive functioning, potentially attributed to genetic variations, cognitive resilience, and environmental enrichment, emphasizing the complexity of AD progression in DS.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39455500,Involvement of Complement in Alzheimer's Disease: From Genetics Through Pathology to Therapeutic Strategies.,"Complement is a critical component of innate immunity, evolved to defend against pathogens and clear toxic debris ranging from dead and dying cells to immune complexes. These roles make complement a key player in homeostasis; however, complement has a dark side. When the rigid control mechanisms fail, complement becomes dysregulated, acting as a driver of inflammation and resultant pathology in numerous diseases. Roles of complement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias have emerged in recent years, supported by genetic, biomarker and pathological evidence and animal model studies. Numerous questions remain regarding the precise roles of complement in the brain in health and disease, including where and when complement is expressed, how it contributes to immune defence and garbage disposal in the healthy brain, and exactly how complement contributes to pathology in dementias. In this brief review, we will summarise current knowledge on complement roles in brain, present the evidence implicating complement in AD and explore whether complement represents an attractive therapeutic target for AD.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences
39847924,LC-MS/MS based analytical strategies for the detection of lipid peroxidation products in biological matrices.,"Oxidative stress (OS) arises mainly from exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide. These molecules can cause significant damage to proteins, DNA, and lipids, leading to various diseases. Cells fight ROS with detoxifying enzymes; however, an imbalance can cause damage leading to ischemic conditions, heart disease progression, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Accurate assessment of OS levels is then crucial and oxidized lipidic products are considered relevant OS biomarkers. In fact, lipids are particularly prone to ROS attack, leading to lipid peroxidation, cell membrane damage, and toxic by-products affecting DNA, proteins, and low-density lipoproteins. This review reports on recent advances in LC-MS/MS approaches for OS lipidic biomarkers, focusing on overcoming analytical challenges. 3 different classes of biomarkers have been reported, malondialdehyde, isoprostanes and oxidised sterols. For each class, the main analytical challenges with a particular focus on derivatisation procedure, sensitivity, matrix effect, ionisation have been described and discussed. The recent advancements of the LC-MS-MS procedures move towards simpler approaches, reducing errors and improving the reliability of the measurement thus enabling a comprehensive and robust OS assessment.",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis
39702989,Multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers and subtle cognitive decline in a population-based cohort without dementia.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between subtle cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as measured by biomarkers in settings outside of specialty memory clinics is not well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how subtle longitudinal cognitive decline relates to neuroimaging biomarkers in individuals drawn from a population-based study in an economically depressed, small-town area in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA. METHODS: A subset of participants without dementia (N = 115, age 76.53 years ± 6.25) from the Monongahela Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) study completed neuroimaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-signature region cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and [(18)F]AV-1451-PET for tau deposition. Neuropsychological evaluations were completed at multiple timepoints up to 11 years prior to neuroimaging. Aβ positivity was determined using a regional approach. We used linear mixed models to examine neuroimaging biomarker associations with retrospective cognitive slopes in five domains and a global cognitive composite. RESULTS: Among Aβ(+) participants (38%), there were associations between (i) tau Braak III/IV and language decline (p < 0.05), (ii) cortical thickness and both memory decline (p < 0.001) and global cognitive decline (p < 0.01), and (iii) WMH and decline in executive function (p < 0.05) and global cognition (p < 0.05). Among Aβ(-) participants, there was an association between tau Braak III/IV and decline on tests of attention/psychomotor speed (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm an Aβ-dependent early AD biomarker pathway, and suggest a possible Aβ-independent, non-AD process underlying subtle cognitive decline in a population-based sample of older adults without dementia.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39863326,Cerebral perfusion correlates with amyloid deposition in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) may contribute to the initial stages of the pathophysiological process in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hypoperfusion has been observed in several brain regions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the clinical significance of CBF changes in the early stages of AD is currently unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, diagnostic value and cognitive correlation of cerebral perfusion measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with MCI due to AD. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of fifty-nine MCI patients and 49 cognitively unimpaired controls (CUCs) were recruited and underwent multimodal MRI scans, including pseudocontinuous ASL, and neurocognitive testing. MCI patients were dichotomously classified according to the presence of amyloid deposition on (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). MEASUREMENTS: The differences in CBF and expression of the AD-related perfusion pattern (ADRP), established by spatial covariance analysis in our previous study, were compared between the PiB+ MCI group and the CUC group and between the PiB+ and PiB- MCI groups. The diagnostic accuracy and correlations with cognitive function scores for CBF and ADRP expression were further analyzed. RESULTS: Hypoperfusion in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was more characteristic of patients with MCI due to AD than of those with non-AD-related MCI. The relative regional CBF value of the left precuneus best distinguished patients with MCI due to AD from CUCs and patients with MCI due to non-AD conditions. Cerebral perfusion, as indicated by either the relative regional CBF or the expression score of the ADRP, was strongly correlated with certain cognitive function scores. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that changes in CBF in the precuneus/PCC are promising MRI biomarkers for the identification of an AD etiology in patients with MCI. ASL, a noninvasive and cost-effective tool, has broad application prospects in the screening and early diagnosis of AD.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39832406,Reactive EEG Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline with currently no effective treatment available. One of the most critical areas in AD research is the identification of reliable biomarkers, which are essential for accurate diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and the development of targeted therapies. In this study, we introduce two novel reactive EEG (rEEG) biomarkers aimed at enhancing the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These biomarkers, previously unexplored in the literature, offer new insights into differentiating between various cognitive states. The first biomarker demonstrates a significant ability to distinguish between AD patients and normal controls (NC), while also effectively distinguishing MCI patients from NC. The second biomarker is designed to identify a subset of AD patients exhibiting hyperconductivity or hyperactivity, characterized by distinctive neural electrical patterns. A cohort of 90 elderly participants (mean age 76.63 ± 6.08 years) was recruited, including 30 AD patients, 30 individuals with MCI, and 30 NC subjects. Psychiatric diagnoses of participants were made by qualified professionals at Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, utilizing comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. Notably, the rEEG biomarkers achieved accuracies of 95%, 95%, and 98% in distinguishing between AD and NC, AD and MCI, and MCI and NC groups, respectively. These results underscore the potential of rEEG as a highly accurate and reliable diagnostic tool for cognitive impairments, including AD and MCI.",Biosensors & bioelectronics
39873919,"Cognitive variation reflects amyloid, tau, and neurodegenerative biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.","In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation of neuropathological markers such as amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cortical neurodegeneration occurs over many years before overt manifestation of cognitive impairment. There is thus a need for neuropsychological markers that are indicative of pathological changes in the early stages of the disease. Intra-individual cognitive variability (IICV), defined as the variation of an individual's performance across cognitive domains, is a promising neuropsychological marker measuring heterogeneous changes in cognition that may reflect these early pathological changes. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the global and regional associations of IICV with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD biomarkers in cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants. We found that higher IICV was robustly associated with increased Aβ, increased tau, decreased brain glucose metabolism, and reduced cortical thickness. Higher IICV was also associated with tau (OR = 2.53, P < .001) and fluorodeoxyglucose (OR = 1.34, P < .001) positivity but not Aβ positivity (OR = 1.15, P = .107). In regional analyses, IICV showed widespread associations with AD biomarkers, with the strongest Aβ and tau effects in the frontal and temporal regions, respectively. The strongest regional cortical thickness effects were found in the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Our findings suggest that IICV may be a useful neuropsychological marker for increased Aβ, and especially increased tau and neurodegeneration that are reflective of emerging AD pathology in individuals without dementia.",GeroScience
40491829,A compilation of reported alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid proteome in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder, with diverse underlying pathophysiological processes extending beyond amyloid-β and tau accumulation. The heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease necessitates the identification of a broad array of biomarkers that capture the diverse mechanisms contributing to disease onset and progression. In this study, we systematically compiled and analysed cerebrospinal fluid proteomics data from omics studies utilizing mass spectrometry, Olink, or SomaScan platforms. Systematic literature searches for each platform revealed a total of 264 studies. From this, a set of 18 studies were selected based on sample size, number of markers analysed, and open data availability. We found a total of 1,448 differentially expressed proteins between Alzheimer's disease and amyloid negative controls across these datasets, with 635 being found in more than one study. A 'top' set of 61 differentially expressed proteins were consistently reported in at least six studies. Clustering and functional enrichment analysis of the top differentially expressed proteins indicated involvement in metabolic regulation, glutathione metabolism and proteins of the 14-3-3 family, reflecting importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) response. Synaptic signalling processes were found to generally be downregulated. We further integrated the top differentially expressed proteins with results from a study on familial Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid to assess at which stage of disease progression these proteins change, highlighting markers shared between sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease datasets. Lastly, we examine the overlap of the top differentially expressed proteins between cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue using a publicly available database. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid proteomic landscape, indicating changes in key pathways and cellular processes associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. By integrating data from different platforms, we highlight reproducible protein changes that may serve as promising candidates for further biomarker research aimed at improving patient stratification, tracking disease progression, and assessing therapeutic interventions.",Brain communications
39662528,"""Current and emerging drug therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A pathophysiological Perspective"".","The analytical and experimental investigation of several targets and biomarkers that help in explaining significant cognitive deficits, covering drug development and precision medicine aimed at different chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, synaptic dysfunction, brain damage from neuronal apoptosis, and other disease pathologies; this served as the foundation for all phase studies. The focus of current therapeutic approaches is on developing humanized antibodies, agonist and antagonist drugs, receptors, signaling molecules, major targeted drug-metabolizing enzymes, and other metabolites to treat neurodegeneration in the AD brain brought on by tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid plagues, or other cholinergic effects. The five A's-amnesia, agnosia, aphasia, apraxia, and anomia-are the typical symptoms associated with AD. While the main goal of drug therapeutics studies is modified amino acids acting as pro-drugs, pharmacokinetics studies and trends in evaluating drug-drug interactions focus on interactions between drugs and antibodies, drugs and therapeutic biologics like metabolites, herbs, interleukin-based, and gene silencing mechanism-based. Studies on the biotransformation of xenobiotic compounds and the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous substances are conducted under Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III trials because the pivotal pharmacokinetic properties of drugs, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), aid in understanding variations in the crucial improvement of various target drugs. This review also highlights the developments in soon-to-be genetically created targeted medications that may serve as ground-breaking treatments for cholinergic illnesses in the brains of AD patients and other neurodegenerative conditions.",Neuroscience
39781717,Untangling the Genetic Threads of Alzheimer's: Insights into Risk Factors and Biomarkers.,"Dementia is a comprehensive term that refers to illnesses characterized by a decline in cognitive memory and other cognitive functions, affecting a person's overall ability to operate. The exact causes of dementia are unknown to this day. The heterogeneity of Alzheimer's indicates the contribution of genetic polymorphism to this disease. This disease is the most prevalent and damaging illness. Studies indicate that the global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exceeds 26 million individuals. Investigation of variations in many genes indicates that these variations may be linked to the susceptibility to AD. Additional genetic factors could potentially influence AD. Analysis of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in this context reveals a correlation between certain variants and AD. Regardless, Alzheimer's disease is always influenced by a particular APOE gene allele. The study's findings indicate that risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to polymorphisms in the following genes: BDNF, presenilin-1 (PS-1), presenilin-2 (PS-2), LRP, APP, CTSD,5-6HT, TREM2, TNF-α, LPL, Clusterin (CLU), SORL1 (Sortilin-Related Receptor), PICALM, Complement Receptor 1 (CR1), and APOE genes.",Current gene therapy

Cognitively unimpaired participants (n = 89) were included from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (mean age 75.37; 44 % male). Participants provided dietary, depressive and anxiety symptom data, and had measurement of blood-based biomarkers. Dietary pattern scores (Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), and Western diet) were generated. Moderation and simple slope analyses were employed. In males with mean and below mean MeDi adherence, depressive symptoms were associated with higher neurofilament light (NfL) levels. In Apolipoprotein E ε4 non-carriers with lower than mean and mean MeDi adherence, depressive symptoms were associated with higher NfL and Aβ40 levels. No associations were observed between DASH and Western diets and neurodegeneration-related biomarkers. MeDi adherence is potentially a moderator of the relationship between depressive symptoms and neurodegeneration-related blood-based biomarkers, with sex- and genotype-specific approaches important to consider within this relationship.",Neurobiology of aging
39841474,Cerebral Microbleeds and Amyloid Pathology Estimates From the Amyloid Biomarker Study.,"IMPORTANCE: Baseline cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and APOE ε4 allele copy number are important risk factors for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) receiving therapies to lower amyloid-β plaque levels. OBJECTIVE: To provide prevalence estimates of any, no more than 4, or fewer than 2 CMBs in association with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy number, and age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data included in the Amyloid Biomarker Study data pooling initiative (January 1, 2012, to the present [data collection is ongoing]). Data from 15 research and memory clinic studies were pooled and harmonized. Participants included individuals for whom data on age, cognitive status, amyloid status, and presence of CMBs were available. Data were analyzed from October 22, 2023, to April 26, 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were age, cognitive status, amyloid status and presence, location, and number of CMBs. Presence of amyloid pathology was determined based on 42 amino acid-long form of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42) levels in cerebrospinal fluid or on amyloid-positron emission tomography. Presence and, in a subset, location (lobar vs deep) and number of CMBs were determined on magnetic resonance imaging (locally with visual rating). RESULTS: Among 4080 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 66.5 (8.9) years, and 2241 (54.9%) were female. A total of 2973 participants had no cognitive impairment (cognitive unimpairment [CU]), and 1107 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia (ADD). One thousand five hundred and thirteen participants (37.1%) had amyloid pathology, 1368 of 3599 (38.0%) with data available were APOE ε4 carriers, and 648 (15.9%) had CMBs. In the CU group, amyloid pathology and APOE ε4 copy number were not associated with presence of any, no more than 4, or fewer than 2 CMBs but were associated with increased odds of lobar CMBs (odds ratio [OR] for amyloid, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.20-1.69], P < .001; OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.19-2.74], P = .006; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.83-1.46], P = .49; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.64 [95% CI, 0.90-2.97], P = .11; overall P = .02). In the MCI-ADD group, amyloid pathology was associated with presence of any CMBs (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.17-1.96], P = .002), no more than 4 CMBs (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.18-1.82], P = .002), and fewer than 2 CMBs (OR 1.34 [95% CI, 1.03-1.74], P = .03) but not lobar CMBs. APOE ε4 copy number was associated with presence of any (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.72 [95% CI, 0.88-3.35], P = .11; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.59-1.04], P = .09; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.32-3.67], P = .002; overall P < .001) and no more than 4 CMBs (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.64-2.68], P = .45; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.54-1.04], P = .08; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.97-3.19], P = .06; overall P = .03) but not with fewer than 2 or lobar CMBs. Prevalence estimates of CMBs ranged from 6% at 50 years of age in a non-APOE ε4 allele carrier with no amyloid pathology and no cognitive impairment to 52% at 90 years of age in an APOE ε4 homozygote carrier with amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of 4080 participants, prevalence estimates of CMBs were associated with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy number, and age. CMB prevalence estimates may help inform safety evaluations for antiamyloid clinical trials.",JAMA network open
39794837,Association and multimodal model of retinal and blood-based biomarkers for detection of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The potential diagnostic value of plasma amyloidogenic beta residue 42/40 ratio (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), neurofilament light (NfL), tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau181), and threonine-217 (p-tau217) has been extensively discussed in the literature. We have also previously described the association between retinal biomarkers and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to evaluate the association, and a multimodal model of, retinal and plasma biomarkers for detection of preclinical AD. METHODS: We included 82 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants (141 eyes; mean age: 67 years; range: 56-80) from the Atlas of Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer's Study (ARIAS). Blood samples were assessed for concentrations of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, NfL, p-tau181, and p-tau217 (ALZpath, Inc.) using Single molecule array (SIMOA) technology. The Spectralis II system (Heidelberg Engineering) was used to acquire macular centered Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images for evaluation of putative retinal gliosis surface area and macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL) thickness. For all participants, correlations (adjusted for age and correlation between eyes) were assessed between retinal and blood-based biomarkers. A subgroup cohort of 57 eyes from 32 participants with recent Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) results, comprising 18 preclinical patients (Aβ PET + ve, 32 eyes) and 14 controls (Aβ PET -ve, 25 eyes) with a mean age of 69 vs. 66, p = 0.06, was included for the assessment of a multimodal model to distinguish between the two groups. For this subgroup cohort, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the multimodal model of retinal and plasma biomarkers vs. each biomarker alone to distinguish between the two groups. RESULTS: Significant correlation was found between putative retinal gliosis and p-tau217 in the univariate mixed model (β = 0.48, p = 0.007) but not for the other plasma biomarkers (p > 0.05). This positive correlation was also retained in the multivariate mixed model (β = 0.43, p = 0.022). The multimodal ROC model based on retinal (gliosis area, inner inferior RNFL thickness, inner superior RNFL thickness, and inner nasal RNFL thickness) and plasma biomarkers (p-tau217 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio) had an excellent AUC of 0.97 (95% CI = 0.93-1.01; p < 0.001) compared to unimodal models of retinal and plasma biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses show the potential of integrating retinal and blood-based biomarkers for improved detection and screening of preclinical AD.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
38847164,A Comprehensive Review on Deep Learning Techniques in Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a serious neurological illness that causes memory loss gradually by destroying brain cells. This deadly brain illness primarily strikes the elderly, impairing their cognitive and bodily abilities until brain shrinkage occurs. Modern techniques are required for an accurate diagnosis of AD. Machine learning has gained attraction in the medical field as a means of determining a person's risk of developing AD in its early stages. One of the most advanced soft computing neural network-based Deep Learning (DL) methodologies has garnered significant interest among researchers in automating early-stage AD diagnosis. Hence, a comprehensive review is necessary to gain insights into DL techniques for the advancement of more effective methods for diagnosing AD. This review explores multiple biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and various DL methodologies, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), The k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN), Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN), which have been employed for automating the early diagnosis of AD. Moreover, the unique contributions of this review include the classification of ATN biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), systemic description of diverse DL algorithms for early AD assessment, along with a discussion of widely utilized online datasets such as ADNI, OASIS, etc. Additionally, this review provides perspectives on future trends derived from critical evaluation of each variant of DL techniques across different modalities, dataset sources, AUC values, and accuracies.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry
39838483,Short-term variability of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in a mixed memory clinic cohort.,"BACKGROUND: For clinical implementation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers (BBMs), knowledge of short-term variability, is crucial to ensure safe and correct biomarker interpretation, i.e., to capture changes or treatment effects that lie beyond that of expected short-term variability and considered clinically relevant. In this study we investigated short-term intra- and inter-individual variability of AD biomarkers in the intended use population, memory clinic patients. METHODS: In a consecutive sample of memory clinic patients (AD n = 27, non-AD n = 20), blood samples were collected on three separate days within a period of 36 days and analysed for plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, T-tau, neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We measured intra- and inter-individual variability and explored if the variability could be affected by confounding factors. Secondly, we established the minimum change required to detect a difference between two given blood samples that exceeds intra-individual variability and analytical variation (reference change value, RCV). Finally, we tested if classification accuracy varied across the three visits. RESULTS: Intra-individual variability ranged from ~ 3% (Aβ42/40) to ~ 12% (T-tau). Inter-individual variability ranged from ~ 7% (Aβ40) to ~ 39% (NfL). Adjusting the models for time, eGFR, Hba1c, and BMI did not affect the variation. RCV was lowest for Aβ42/Aβ40 (- ~ 15%/ + ~ 17%) and highest in p-tau181 (- ~ 30/ + ~ 42%). No variation in classification accuracies was found across visits. CONCLUSION: We found low intra-individual variability, robust to various factors, appropriate to capture individual changes in AD BBMs, while moderate inter-individual variability may give rise to caution in diagnostic contexts. High RCVs may pose challenges for AD BBMs with low fold changes and consequently, short-term variability is important to take into consideration when, e.g., estimating intervention effect and longitudinal changes of AD BBM levels.

40101674,A practical overview of the use of amyloid-PET Centiloid values in clinical trials and research.,"The density of brain amyloid-beta neuritic plaque accumulation, a marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be visualized and quantified using amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET). Amyloid-PET data can be obtained using different tracers and methodologies; therefore, comparison across studies can be difficult. The introduction of Centiloids in 2015 allowed for the transformation of amyloid-PET quantitative data to a common scale, enhancing comparability across studies and potentially enabling pooled analysis. Since then, Centiloid values have been used increasingly in research and clinical trials for multiple purposes, being tested and validated with a variety of clinical, biomarker and pathological standards of truth. In clinical trials, Centiloid values have been used for patient selection, to confirm the presence of AD pathology, as well as for treatment monitoring, especially in trials of disease-modifying treatments such as amyloid-targeting therapies. Building on their widespread adoption, Centiloid values are increasingly being integrated into commercially available software solutions for quantifying amyloid-PET, paving the way for real-world applications at the community level. This article addresses frequently asked questions about Centiloid definition, implementation, interpretation, and caveats, and also summarizes the available literature on published thresholds, ultimately supporting wider access and informed use of Centiloid values in Alzheimer's disease research.",NeuroImage.

39161136,A Comprehensive Review on Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Models: Evaluating their Clinical Relevance.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that increases with age and must be treated immediately by worldwide healthcare systems. Internal neurofibrillary tau tangles and extracellular amyloid accumulation have been widely recognized as the primary causes of Alzheimer's disease. These degenerative age-related ailments are expected to proliferate exponentially as life expectancy rises. Experimental models of AD are essential for acquiring a deep knowledge of its pathogenesis and determining the viability of novel therapy options. Although there isn't a model that encompasses all the characteristics of real AD, these models are nonetheless highly helpful for the research of various modifications associated with it, even though they are only partially indicative of the disease circumstances being studied. Better knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the different models, as well as the use of more than one model to evaluate potential medications, would increase the effectiveness of therapy translation from preclinical research to patients. We outline the pathogenic characteristics and limitations of the main experimental models of AD in this review, including transgenic mice, transgenic rats, primates and non-primate models along with in-vitro cell culture models in humans. Additionally, it highlights the possible future of experimental modeling of AD and includes the co-morbid models.",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology
39566740,Mapping Alzheimer's disease stages toward it's progression: A comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal study using resting-state fMRI and graph theory.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional brain connectivity of resting-state networks varies as Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses. However, our understanding of the dynamic longitudinal changes that occur in the brain over the course of AD is sometimes contradictory and lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed whole-brain networks connectivity using longitudinal resting-state fMRI data from 132 participants from ADNI dataset. The cohort was divided into four groups: 20 AD, 35 CN, 46 Early MCI, and 31 Late MCI Cross-sectional analyses were conducted at baseline and follow-up (approximately two years apart), with longitudinal changes assessed within and between groups. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses revealed that all groups differed significantly from AD in global network properties at both time points, with EMCI also showing disrupted topological metrics compared to CN. Longitudinal analyses highlighted notable changes in small-worldness (σ), global clustering coefficient (Cp), and normalized characteristic path length (λ) across groups. Both EMCI and LMCI groups showed significant alterations in global efficiency (Eglob), Cp, and σ over time. Pairwise comparisons also revealed significant interaction effects, particularly between CN-EMCI and CN-AD groups. All groups showed notable changes in σ, λ, and Cp, according to within-group longitudinal changes. Furthermore, distinct changes in Eglob over time were observed in the LMCI and EMCI groups. Almost all subnetwork attributes demonstrated significant changes between patients at various phases in both time intervals. CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize significant connectivity alterations across all groups at both baseline and follow-up, with longitudinal analyses underscoring the progression of these changes. Graph theory metrics provide valuable insights into the transition from normal cognition to AD, potentially serving as biomarkers for disease progression.",Ageing research reviews

This study aims to explore this association in an ethno-racially diverse sample of cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling adults. METHODS: Data clinical examinations, neuropsychological tests, blood draws, and PF exams (Timed Up and Go [TUG] and Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]) were analyzed. Multivariable linear regressions assessed the association between PF and AD plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ]40, Aβ42, total tau [t-tau], neurofiliament light chain [NfL]). RESULTS: The sample (n = 2358; mean age 64.7 years; 65.9% female), was 20% African American, 41.9% non-Hispanic White, and 38.1% Hispanic. Findings indicate that worse PF is linked to higher biomarker levels (p < 0.05). Associations differed by race and ethnicity group. TUG time was associated (p < 0.05) with Aβ40, Aβ42, and tau among non-Hispanic Whites, whereas SPPB scores were associated (p < 0.05) with t-tau and NfL among African Americans. DISCUSSION: PF, ethnic/racial, and plasma AD biomarker data should be used to aid in developing risk profiles for neurodegenerative diseases.

Although their usefulness has been demonstrated, their potential value in older patients remains debated. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether knowledge of the results of CSF AD biomarkers was associated with the same gain in diagnostic confidence in older adults > 80 than in younger patients. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter study, including memory clinics physicians who completed a two-part questionnaire for all their patients addressing the requirement for assessment of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in CSF proposed as part of routine care during the study period. SETTING: 30 secondary or tertiary memory clinics in France. MEASUREMENTS: Clinicians indicated their diagnosis hypothesis and an estimate of their diagnostic confidence [scale 1-10]. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, including the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was conducted using logistic regression to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CSF AD biomarkers. RESULTS: In 813 consecutive patients, median age 70 [interquartile range (IQR) = 63 - 77] including 132 patients over 80 years, we observed a similar confidence gain in CSF biomarkers between older and younger patients, both for AD and non-AD diagnoses. In older patients, the added value of CSF biomarkers was greater when CSF biomarkers indicated AD profile whereas the initial hypothesis was ""non-AD"", leading to a final diagnosis of AD (2.4 ± 1.6 versus 1.1 ± 2.1, p-value, p = 0.03). ROC analyses showed similar performance of AD CSF biomarkers in older and younger patients. CONCLUSION: CSF AD biomarkers added substantial value to clinical assessment in patients over 80. Their use seems crucial in the diagnostic process for older adults referred to memory clinics.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease

40529145,Integrating genetic and immune profiles for personalized immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide, and it is estimated that the number of patients will increase to 131 million by 2050. Most of the current methods of dealing with AD are designed to alleviate the symptoms, and there is no effective way of stopping the progression of the disease. Personalized immunotherapy has the potential to be highly effective and cut down on side effects because it can be targeted accurately and intervened early. Considering the genetic factors, many studies are increasingly looking at taking the immune status into account. This article further discusses the genetic and immune characteristics of AD, the methods of integrating multiple histological data, the identification of biomarkers, the stratification of patients, the precise treatment plans, and the application and future trends of immunotherapy, giving new directions for the future treatment of AD. In this mini-review, the authors address the critical role that genetic background and immune status play in shaping therapeutic strategies for AD, noting that there is a unique immune response in carriers of the APOEε4 allele compared to non-carriers, and that this difference may affect the course of the disease as well as the efficacy of immunotherapy. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current understanding of the influence of genetic and immune factors on each other in AD, focusing on the impact of the APOEε4 allele on the immune response and its implications for immunotherapy.",Frontiers in medicine
39824235,"Associations of blood-based biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases with mortality, cardio- and cerebrovascular events in persons with chronic coronary syndrome.","BACKGROUND: In light of growing evidence highlighting interactions between cardiac and brain health, we investigated associations of biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases with adverse outcomes (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, and stroke) in persons with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). METHODS: We used data from a cohort of persons with CCS for whom major adverse events were recorded over a follow-up of 20 years. We measured biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in baseline blood samples, using the Single-Molecule Array Technology on a HD-1 Analyzer. These include biomarkers of neuronal (neurofilament light chain (NfL) (n = 379)) and glial neurodegeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (n = 379)), and Alzheimer's disease pathology (phosphorylated tau181 (n = 379), total tau (n = 377), and amyloid β (Aβ(40), Aβ(42), Aβ(42)/Aβ(40)) (n = 377)). We applied Cox-proportional hazards models to evaluate associations of these biomarkers with adverse outcomes, adjusting for covariates and exploring interactions with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 genotype. RESULTS: Participants with higher NfL levels had increased rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Hazard ratio per increase by one standard deviation (95 % confidence interval): all-cause mortality: 1.36 (1.10-1.68); cardiovascular mortality: 1.42 (1.05-1.93)). The Aβ(40)/Aβ(42)-ratio was linked to incident stroke (0.72 (0.52-1.00)). Associations of GFAP with all-cause mortality and incident stroke were depending on ApoE ε4 genotype. The other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the studied outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In persons with CSS, NfL and the Aβ(40)/Aβ(42)-ratio were related to mortality and incident stroke, respectively, whereas associations of GFAP with adverse outcomes varied by ApoE genotype. These biomarkers might play a role in linking aging, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.",Experimental gerontology
39968692,Dissociable spatial topography of cortical atrophy in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: A head-to-head comparison of the LEADS and ADNI cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD, respectively) have distinct clinical manifestations, with prior work based on small samples suggesting unique patterns of neurodegeneration. The current study performed a head-to-head comparison of cortical atrophy in EOAD and LOAD, using two large and well-characterized cohorts (LEADS and ADNI). METHODS: We analyzed brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired from 377 sporadic EOAD patients and 317 sporadicLOAD patients who were amyloid positive and had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia (i.e., early-stage AD), along with cognitively unimpaired participants. RESULTS: After controlling for the level of cognitive impairment, we found a double dissociation between AD clinical phenotype and localization/magnitude of atrophy, characterized by predominant neocortical involvement in EOAD and more focal anterior medial temporal involvement in LOAD. DISCUSSION: Our findings point to the clinical utility of MRI-based biomarkers of atrophy in differentiating between EOAD and LOAD, which may be useful for diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment. HIGHLIGHTS: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) patients showed distinct and overlapping cortical atrophy patterns. EOAD patients showed prominent atrophy in widespread neocortical regions. LOAD patients showed prominent atrophy in the anterior medial temporal lobe. Regional atrophy was correlated with the severity of global cognitive impairment. Results were comparable when the sample was stratified for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
40166757,"Relationship Between Peripheral Serum Adiponectin and Cerebrospinal Fluid TNF-α, IL-1β, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid and Perioperative Neurocognitive Dysfunction in Elderly Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroplasty.","BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND) represents a form of cognitive impairment related to surgery and anesthesia, which may manifest hours or even weeks after the surgical procedure, persist, and potentially progress into Alzheimer's disease. The etiology of PND is intricate, with central nervous inflammation playing a crucial role. The clinical manifestations of PND are not distinctive, no obvious image alterations are observable, and the diagnosis rate is relatively low, thereby influencing prognosis and augmenting postoperative complications and mortality. The optimal treatment approach for PND lies in timely identification and management of the high-risk factors causing PND and implementing early prevention. We hypothesize that the level of peripheral blood adiponectin (APN) is correlated with PND, potentially through inhibiting the central inflammatory response and regulating brain energy metabolism. METHODS: Fifty elderly patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty under continuous epidural spinal anesthesia (CESA) were included. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days. Serum APN and CSF levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, lactic acid, and pyruvic acid were measured. The occurrence of PND was recorded, and the patients were divided into a PND group and a non-PND group. RESULTS: PND occurred in 16 patients (34.04%). The PND group had lower serum APN levels and higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and lactic acid compared to the non-PND group. CSF TNF-α and IL-1β levels were negatively correlated with serum APN concentration. These biomarkers are associated with PND occurrence and have high diagnostic value. CONCLUSION: Decreases in serum APN and increases in TNF-α, IL-1β, and lactic acid in CSF may be involved in the pathophysiological process of PND in elderly patients after surgery.",Clinical interventions in aging
39868491,A multi-cohort study of longitudinal and cross-sectional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired older adults.,"INTRODUCTION: The generalizability of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in their sensitivity to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and power to predict progression in large, multisite cohorts remains unclear. METHOD: Longitudinal demographics, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive scores of 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults (amyloid beta [Aβ]-negative/positive [A-/A+]: 1270/1558) were included. Cross-sectional and longitudinal cognition and medial temporal lobe (MTL) structural measures were extracted. Cross-sectional MTL tau burden (T) was computed from tau positron emission tomography (N = 1095). RESULTS: We found cross-sectional tau and longitudinal structural biomarkers best separated A+ CU from A- CU. A-T+ CU had significantly faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau was significantly correlated with MRI and cognitive biomarkers regardless of Aβ status. MTL tau, MRI, and cognition provided complementary information about disease progression. DISCUSSION: This large multisite study replicates prior findings in CU older adults, supporting the utility of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in preclinical AD clinical trials and normal aging studies. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau and longitudinal MTL atrophy best separate amyloid beta positive (A+) CU from amyloid beta negative (A-) CU. A- tau positive (T+) CU had a significantly faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau correlated with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognition regardless of amyloid beta status. Combined baseline MTL tau, MRI, and cognition best predict Alzheimer's disease progression.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
40167924,Unraveling Potential Tauopathy Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid: Insights from Olfactory Tract Data.,"Due to the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is estimated to grow considerably in the next decades. Unfortunately, there are no current curative treatments for the majority of these disorders and this might be due to the lack of early diagnosis. Nowadays, diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders is mainly based on neuroimaging and clinical symptoms, although postmortem neuropathologic confirmation remains the gold-standard diagnostic technique. In this sense, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome is considered a valuable molecular repository for diagnosing and targeting the neurodegenerative process. On the other hand, olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom that affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies' patients. That is why we consider that the application of tissue proteomics in primary olfactory structures is an ideal approach to explore early pathophysiological changes, detecting olfactory proteins that might be tested in CSF as potential biomarkers. In this chapter, we have applied peptide fractionation methods followed by tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS), in silico analysis and semi-quantitative orthogonal techniques in the olfactory tract derived from AD subjects. After obtaining the differential OT proteome, we suggest that the use of different bioinformatic workflows might be a valuable workflow to discover potential disease biomarkers for AD and other tauopathies.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)"

40567815,Predicting brain health in community-dwelling elderly populations by integrating Gaussian mixture model and plasma biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and early screening is crucial for intervention. OBJECTIVE: Currently, early screening for older adults without dementia primarily rely on cognitive scale. This study aims to explore a more feasible approach. METHODS: Plasma biomarkers (Aβ(42/40), p-tau181 and p-tau217) and Gaussian mixture models (GMM) were utilized for stratifying risk levels in older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Linear mixed effects model was employed to compare subsequent pathological and cognitive changes, alongside a comparison with traditional scale-based screening methods. Cox regression model was used to assess the risk of progression to dementia across different biomarker status groups. RESULTS: Plasma Aβ(42/40) and p-tau217 effectively predicted Aβ PET pathological progression, while p-tau217 also predicted tau PET changes. All three biomarkers could forecast the progression of FDG PET and cognitive function. P-tau217 and p-tau181 significantly modulated pathology-related cognitive impairment. All three biomarkers could predict dementia risk. The screening method combining GMM with plasma biomarkers demonstrates superior predictive ability compared to traditional scale-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that the combination of GMM and plasma biomarkers for community screening shows promising potential in monitoring brain health among older adults without dementia. P-tau217 exhibited the best predictive value among the three plasma biomarkers.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports

39737769,"Insights Into Retinal Pathologies in Neurological Disorders: A Focus on Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's Disease.","Neurological diseases are central nervous system (CNS) disorders affecting the whole body. Early diagnosis of the diseases is difficult due to the lack of disease-specific tests. Adding new biomarkers external to the CNS facilitates the diagnosis of neurological diseases. In this respect, the retina has a common embryologic origin with the CNS. Retinal imaging technologies including optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used in the understanding and processual monitoring of neurological diseases. Retinal imaging has been recently recognized as a potential source of biomarkers for neurological diseases, increasing the number of studies in this direction. In this review, the association of retinal abnormalities with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained. Structural and functional abnormalities in retina as a predictive marker may facilitate early diagnosis of diseases. Although not all retinal abnormalities are predictive of neurologic diseases, changes in the retinal layers including retinal pigment epithelium and plexiform layers should suggest the risk of PD, MS, ALS, and AD.",Journal of neuroscience research
40496670,Multisite chronic pain: association with cognitive decline and post-mortem Alzheimer's biomarkers.,"Multisite chronic pain is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but its relationship with Alzheimer's pathology remains unclear. This study examines the association between multisite chronic pain and single-site chronic pain with cognitive decline and post-mortem Alzheimer's biomarkers in older adults. We conducted a longitudinal and prospective observational study using data from 3459 participants without dementia at baseline in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. Participants (mean age = 77.94, SD = 7.93 years) were followed for an average of 8.53 years (SD = 5.74), with cognitive assessments and post-mortem biomarker analyses in a subset of brain donors (n range from 863 to 987 based on assay quality and tissue preservation). Cognitive function was measured using repeated assessments of five cognitive domains and a global composite score. Chronic pain was classified based on self-reported pain, determined by the number of joint sites affected during the first two assessments: Multisite chronic pain was defined as chronic pain in more than one site, single-site chronic pain as chronic pain in one site, and no chronic pain as no chronic pain sites. Brain beta-amyloid (Aβ) load and tau tangle density were assessed post-mortem, ∼10 months after the last clinical evaluation. This was assessed as a global measure across eight Alzheimer's-affected brain regions, as well as specifically in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Apolipoprotein-ɛ4 genotype was determined from blood and tissue samples. Compared to individuals with single-site (n = 506) or no chronic pain (n = 2599), participants with multisite chronic pain (n = 354) showed steeper declines in global cognition, episodic memory and working memory-especially among those with higher apolipoprotein-ɛ4 load-and were more likely to develop Alzheimer's dementia. Multisite chronic pain was also linked to increased Aβ deposition in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, particularly in apolipoprotein-ɛ4 carriers. Compared to people with no chronic pain, single-site chronic pain did not differ on rate of cognitive decline, Alzheimer's dementia risk or post-mortem Alzheimer's biomarkers. Multisite, but not single-site, chronic pain is linked to steeper cognitive decline and increased Aβ deposition, particularly in individuals with elevated Alzheimer's genetic risk. These findings suggest that reducing pain may mitigate the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.",Brain communications
39899917,Ultrasensitive SERS nanoprobe-based multiplexed digital sensing platform for the simultaneous quantification of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that requires early diagnosis to manage its progression. Although the simultaneous detection of multiple AD biomarkers is expected to facilitate early assessment of AD risk, the lack of multiplexed sensing platforms for accurately quantifying multiple AD biomarkers remains a challenge. Here, we present a multiplexed digital sensing platform based on bumpy core-shell (BCS) surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) nanoprobes for ultrasensitive, quantitative, and simultaneous detection of Aβ42 and Aβ40 as AD biomarkers, enabling the accurate determination of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. We synthesized BCS SERS nanoprobes with distinct Raman reporters to generate unique, intense, and reproducible SERS signals, offering single-nanoparticle sensitivity and quantification capabilities. These nanoprobes were subsequently employed in SERS-based immunoassays combined with digital SERS analysis for multiplexed quantification. The proposed platform accurately and quantitatively detected Aβ42 and Aβ40 across a range of five orders of magnitude, with a limit of detection of 8.7× 10(-17) g/mL (1.9 × 10(-17) M) for Aβ42 and 1.0 × 10(-15) g/mL (2.3 × 10(-16) M) for Aβ40, surpassing the performance of conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Based on the exclusive detection of Aβ42 and Aβ40 using distinct SERS nanoprobes, the proposed sensing platform can also accurately quantify Aβ42 and Aβ40 at clinically relevant levels in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma. Therefore, this sensing platform can be used to accurately and reliably determine the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, thus serving as an effective tool for the early diagnosis of AD.",Biosensors & bioelectronics

By synthesizing recent studies, it aims to advance early diagnostic methods to detect AD before significant symptoms occur. OBJECTIVE: Research emphasizes the significance of early detection in AD during the preclinical phase, which does not involve cognitive impairment but nevertheless requires reliable biomarkers. Current biomarkers face challenges, prompting the exploration of cognitive behavior indicators beyond episodic memory. METHODS: Using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we searched Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies on neuropsychiatric disorders utilizing conversational data. RESULTS: Following an analysis of 38 selected articles, we highlight verbal episodic memory as a sensitive preclinical AD marker, with supporting evidence from neuroimaging and genetic profiling. Executive functions precede memory decline, while processing speed is a significant correlate. The potential of VR remains underexplored, and AI algorithms offer a multidimensional approach to early neurocognitive disorder diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging technologies like VR and AI show promise for preclinical diagnostics, but thorough validation and regulation for clinical safety and efficacy are necessary.

39793847,"""Extracellular Vesicle DNA: Advances and Applications as a Non-Invasive Biomarker in Disease Diagnosis and Treatment"".","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale, membrane-enclosed structures released by cells into the extracellular milieu. These vesicles encapsulate a diverse array of molecular constituents, including nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, which provide insights into the physiological or pathological conditions of their parent cells. Despite their potential, the study of EV-derived DNA (EV-DNA) has gathered relatively limited attention. This review aims to present a thorough examination of the emerging knowledge surrounding the utility of EV-DNA as a non-invasive biomarker across a spectrum of diseases. The review delves into various mechanisms underlying DNA packaging within EVs and the prevalent methodologies employed for extraction of EV-DNA. The relevance of EV-DNA is assessed across numerous health conditions, notably cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, infectious diseases, and pregnancy-related complications. The use of EV-DNA for cancer mutation detection has demonstrated remarkable sensitivity and specificity, thereby enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic monitoring. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, EV-DNA serves as a predictive marker for events such as myocardial infarctions and shows a correlation with the severity of the disease. With respect to neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, EV-DNA contributes to the understanding of disease mechanisms and progression. Additionally, it plays an essential role in modulating immune tolerance and facilitating communication between maternal and fetal systems. Although there is a pressing need for standardized protocols for EV isolation and DNA analysis to facilitate clinical implementation, the prospect of EV-DNA as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes across diverse pathological conditions is considerable.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry

However, issues with currently available diagnostic biomarkers preclude early diagnosis, necessitating the development of alternative biomarkers and methods, such as blood-based diagnostics. We propose c-Triadem (constrained triple-input Alzheimer's disease model), a novel deep neural network to identify potential blood-based biomarkers for AD and predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD with high accuracy. The model utilizes genotyping data, gene expression data, and clinical information to predict the disease status of participants, i.e., cognitively normal (CN), MCI, or AD. The nodes of the neural network represent genes and their related pathways, and the edges represent known relationships among the genes and pathways. Simulated data validation further highlights the robustness of key features identified by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). We trained the model with blood genotyping data, microarray, and clinical features from the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Disease Initiative (ADNI). We demonstrate that our model's performance is superior to previous models with an AUC of 97% and accuracy of 89%. We then identified the most influential genes and clinical features for prediction using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our SHAP analysis shows that CASP9, LCK, and SDC3 SNPs and PINK1, ATG5, and ubiquitin (UBB, UBC) expression have a higher impact on model performance. Our model has facilitated the identification of potential blood-based genetic markers of DNA damage response and mitophagy in affected regions of the brain.

METHODS: This study enrolled 575 AD patients, 131 patients with non-AD dementia, and 112 cognitively normal (CN) participants, and AD patients were divided into APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and blood-derived biomolecules were compared between AD and CN groups, between non-AD dementia and CN groups, as well as within APOE ε4 subgroups of AD patients. Utilizing Spearman's correlation analysis and quantile regression analysis, the relationships between blood-derived biomolecules and CSF biomarkers were analyzed in APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers. RESULTS: The levels of CSF biomarkers and blood molecules exhibited significant differences between the AD and CN groups, including Aβ42, t-tau, p-tau 181, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and uric acid. In AD patients, APOE ε4 carriers had increased levels of CSF t-tau, p-tau 181, and plasma LDL. In the correlation and regression analyses, the negative relationships between plasma TG and t-tau, between plasma TG and p-tau 181 levels, as well as the positive relationship between serum IgA and CSF Aβ42, were observed significantly in APOE ε4+ AD groups, but not in APOE ε4- AD group. CONCLUSION: APOE ε4 is associated with accelerated progression of AD pathology. The blood-derived biomolecules correlated with CSF biomarkers in APOE ε4 carriers are related to neuroinflammation and lipid metabolism, which may indicate the role of APOE ε4 in AD pathophysiology and offer insights for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.

In this study, we investigated the association of cognitive symptoms, as measured with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), and amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ1-42) in a group of patients with probable FTD and Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with participants selected from the electronic records of patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital's Memory Clinic, CT. A total of 61 patients, 28 with FTD (mean age=64.1) and 33 with AD (mean age=66.8), with available CSF results and cognitive test scores in their chart were included in analyses. RESULTS: T-tau levels negatively and significantly correlated with total MoCA scores as well as the different MoCA index scores in patients with FTD (r=-0.47, P=0.04). There were no significant associations between MoCA scores and p-tau181 levels in patients with FTD (r=-0.22, P=0.25). Patients with AD exhibited significant correlations between MoCA scores and both t-tau (r=-0.54, P<0.01) and p-tau (r=-0.55, P<0.01) levels. Also, Aβ1-42 levels were not significantly correlated with MoCA scores in either of the FTD and AD groups. CONCLUSION: CSF concentrations of t-tau are inversely correlated to cognitive performance in patients with FTD and both t-tau and p-tau181 in AD. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between clinical cognitive performance and tau-related pathology in FTD in comparison with AD.",Alzheimer disease and associated disorders
39859090,Oxidative Stress and Risk of Dementia in Older Patients with Depression: A Longitudinal Cohort Study Using Plasma Biomarkers.,"Background and Objectives: While depression is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), traditional AD-related biomarkers, such as amyloid-beta, have shown limited predictive value for late-life depression. Oxidative stress has emerged as a potential indicator given its shared role in both depression and dementia. This study investigated the longitudinal relationship between oxidative stress biomarkers and risk of dementia in patients with depression. Materials and Methods: A longitudinal cohort of 146 older patients with major depressive disorder was analyzed. Biomarkers, such as nitrotyrosine, protein carbonyl, F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, were collected at baseline and measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. AD conversion was determined using comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between oxidative stress biomarkers and AD conversion after adjusting for confounders. The log-rank test, using the minimum p-value approach, was applied to determine the optimal cut-off value for significantly associated biomarkers of AD-free survival rates. Results: During the follow-up period ranging from 1.00 to 18.53 years, 41 (28.08%) patients converted to AD. Nitrotyrosine showed a significant association with increased risk of AD (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.01; p = 0.0045). For clinical applicability, patients with plasma nitrotyrosine levels ≥170 nM as the cut-off value had a 5.14-fold increased risk of AD (adjusted HR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.02-13.07; p = 0.0006). Other biomarkers, such as protein carbonyl, F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, were not significantly associated with AD conversion. Conclusions: Nitrotyrosine, a biomarker that reflects nitrosative damage, emerged as a significant predictor of dementia risk in older patients with depression, highlighting its potential as an early biomarker of dementia. Further validation of these results is required using a larger sample size.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"
39845736,Identify biological Alzheimer's disease using a novel nucleic acid-linked protein immunoassay.,"Blood-based biomarkers have been revolutionizing the detection, diagnosis and screening of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, phosphorylated-tau variants (p-tau(181), p-tau(217) and p-tau(231)) are promising biomarkers for identifying Alzheimer's disease pathology. Antibody-based assays such as single molecule arrays immunoassays are powerful tools to investigate pathological changes indicated by blood-based biomarkers and have been studied extensively in the Alzheimer's disease research field. A novel proteomic technology-NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA)-was developed to improve the sensitivity of traditional proximity ligation assays and offer a comprehensive outlook for 120 protein biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the relative novelty of the NULISA technology in quantifying Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, validation through comparisons with more established methods is required. The main objective of the current study was to determine the capability of p-tau variants quantified using NULISA for identifying abnormal amyloid-β and tau pathology. We assessed 397 participants [mean (standard deviation) age, 64.8 (15.7) years; 244 females (61.5%) and 153 males (38.5%)] from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort where participants had plasma measurements of p-tau(181), p-tau(217) and p-tau(231) from NULISA and single molecule arrays immunoassays. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments, including structural MRI, amyloid-PET and tau-PET. Our findings suggest an excellent agreement between plasma p-tau variants quantified using NULISA and single molecule arrays immunoassays. Plasma p-tau(217) measured with NULISA shows excellent discriminative accuracy for abnormal amyloid-PET (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.918, 95% confidence interval = 0.883 to 0.953, P < 0.0001) and tau-PET (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.939; 95% confidence interval = 0.909 to 0.969, P < 0.0001). It also presents the capability for differentiating tau-PET staging. Validation of the NULISA-measured plasma biomarkers adds to the current analytical methods for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, screening and staging and could potentially expedite the development of a blood-based biomarker panel.",Brain communications
39662155,Impact of diabetes on the progression of Alzheimer's disease via trajectories of amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins, such as β-amyloid and tau, in the brain, which precedes cognitive impairment. Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk factor for AD, few studies have investigated how the presence of DM affects the sequential pathogenesis of AD, specifically within the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) and cognition framework. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the trajectories of ATN biomarkers in relation to the presence of DM in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. DESIGN: Participants with normal cognition (CN) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline were included. Subjects were followed for 12-192 months, with neuroimaging and cognitive assessments conducted at every 12 or 24 months. SETTING: This study utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 603 participants aged 55-90 years were included, comprising 284 CN (25 with DM, 259 without DM) and 319 MCI (39 with DM, 280 without DM) individuals. MEASUREMENTS: ATN biomarkers were identified using florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET), flortaucipir PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. Cognition was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Moderation analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of DM on the association between ATN biomarkers of AD. RESULTS: Elevated amyloid standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were associated with increased tau levels in the hippocampus, and this association was significantly enhanced by the presence of DM in MCI participants (p = 0.021). DM also strengthened the association between increased tau SUVR levels and neurodegeneration (indicated by decreased entorhinal cortical volumes; p = 0.005) in those with MCI. Furthermore, DM enhanced the association of decreased entorhinal (p = 0.012) and middle temporal cortex (p = 0.031) volumes with increased (worsened) CDR-SB scores in MCI participants. However, DM did not predict significant longitudinal changes in ATN pathology or cognitive decline in CN participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DM may increase the risk of AD by accelerating each step of the A-T-N cascade in the prodromal stage of AD, underscoring the importance of DM management in preventing the MCI conversion to AD.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging"

All patients underwent lumbar puncture followed by the CSF biomarkers evaluation (beta-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau protein 181 (p-tau181)) to confirm the AD pathology. The clinical characteristics of each subgroup were studied. RESULTS: A decreased level of CSF Aβ1-42 in combination with an increased level of p-tau181 was found in 36 patients (57.1%). A change in at least one biomarker was detected in 54 patients (85.7%). The highest frequency of the Alzheimer's type pathology was found in the group with predominant amnestic phenotype (87.5%), as well as in the subgroups with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) (100%) and with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) (100%). In the group with rare phenotypes, the frequency of AD CSF changes characteristic of AD was 50% for patients with predominant behavioral disorders and 66.7% for corticobasal syndrome. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of AD CSF biomarkers in both the classical (amnesic) and atypical phenotypes is shown. This indicates the need to expand the use of AD CSF biomarkers for a more reliable assessment of the prevalence of AD In Russia.",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova
39791252,Differences of longitudinal plasma biomarkers between single memory domain and multidomain subject cognitive decline: Evidence from SILCODE.,"BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers demonstrated potential in identifying amyloid pathology in early Alzheimer's disease. Different subtypes of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may lead to different cognitive impairment conversion risks. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences of plasma biomarkers in SCD subtypes individuals, which were unclear. METHODS: The 347 individuals were involved, including 93 normal controls (NC), 76 single memory domain SCD (sd-SCD), 79 multidomain SCD (md-SCD), 55 mild cognitive impairment and 44 dementia. We investigated plasma biomarkers (Aβ(42/40), p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP) and neuropsychological scales in the baseline and follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were performed to investigate the risk of cognitive decline conversion. The t-test, Mann-Whitney U and multiple linear regression analysis were employed to evaluate the rate of change and correlation between PET-SUVR and plasma biomarker change. RESULTS: In cognitively normal subjects, md-SCD exhibited lower Aβ(42/40) and higher p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that md-SCD group exhibited a higher risk of cognitive decline conversion compared to NC and sd-SCD. Within SCD subgroups, those with positive GFAP status showed higher conversion risk than negative. In the Cox model, the risk of conversion in the md-SCD group was 2.77 times higher than sd-SCD. The md-SCD group demonstrated a faster rate of Aβ(42/40) decline than sd-SCD. CONCLUSIONS: The study utilized plasma biomarkers to highlight the significance of staging in SCD. In cognitively normal subjects, md-SCD presents a higher risk of cognitive decline than sd-SCD, providing a valuable reference and convenient tool for early identification of individuals at risk for AD.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
40538738,White matter hyperintensities and the risk of vascular dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are hyperintense lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are unique imaging indicators of cerebral small vessel diseases. WMH-related white matter alterations have been correlated with cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular pathology. Some studies suggest that vascular hemodynamic changes contribute to WMH development, ultimately leading to vascular dementia (VaD). However, the association between WMH burden and VaD remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between WMH volume and VaD severity and to clarify the role of WMHs in VaD pathogenesis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. A total of 15 studies with 4,061 patients were selected. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan software (version 5.4) and Stata software (version 14.0). All the patients underwent brain MRI to assess WMH volumes or levels, and compared the differences in WMH levels among the VaD group, the non-cognitively impaired (NCI) group, the cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND) group, and the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group. RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed that all patients in the VaD group had high white matter signals on brain MRI. They also had higher WMH volumes compared to patients in the NCI, CIND, and AD groups. WMH correlated with cerebrovascular pathology, with irregular and periventricular WMHs being more specific to VaD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity, while funnel plot and Egger's test suggested potential publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with VaD exhibit significantly greater WMH than those with AD, NCI, and CIND, reinforcing the role of cerebrovascular pathology in VaD. These findings emphasize the need for standardized imaging assessments, multi-modal biomarkers, and the development of predictive models to enhance early diagnosis, personalized risk assessment, and targeted therapeutic strategies for VaD.",PeerJ
39827005,Influence of APOE ε4 on performance of CSF biomarkers in differentiating clinical Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) bring the higher risk of Alzheimer' Disease (AD). It is essential to evaluate whether the diagnostic performances and critical values of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are influenced by APOE ε4, which has guiding significance for the clinical practical application. METHODS: The differences in CSF biomarkers and their performances between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in distinguishing AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical AD from normal controls (NCs) were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to compare the area under the curve (AUC) between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers, as well as the critical values corresponding Youden Index. RESULTS: In a cross sectional convenience sample of 1610 participants, lower Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher p-Tau 181/Aβ42 in CSF were observed among APOE ε4 carriers than non-carriers in NC, MCI, and AD groups (P< 0.05). The performance of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 in distinguishing MCI from NC among APOE ε4 carriers was superior to non-carriers [AUC: 0.714 (95%CI: 0.673- 0.752) vs 0.600 (95%CI: 0.564- 0.634), P< 0.001], although it was similar in distinguishing AD from NC between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers [AUC: 0.874 (95%CI: 0.835-0.906) vs 0.876 (95%CI: 0.843- 0.904)]. In the longitudinal cohort of 254 participants, the association of CSF Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-Tau181/Aβ42 with cognitive decline were stronger in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (P< 0.05). Meanwhile, the critical values were different depending on APOE genotype. DISCUSSION: The CSF level of p-Tau181/Aβ42 was significantly different between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers at different stages of AD. The results indicate that the performances of CSF biomarkers are influenced by APOE ε4, which should be considered in the practical application.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
40103929,Associations of varicose veins with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies in adults without dementia: the CABLE study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found a correlation between varicose veins (VVs) and cognitive decline, and individuals with VVs have a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associations between VVs and the core pathologies of AD have not yet been investigated. The research was designed to analyze the relationships between VVs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathologies. METHODS: We included 1,298 participants from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) database without dementia. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was applied to assess the relationships between the VVs and CSF AD biomarkers. Then, we conducted subgroup analyses according to age, gender, education levels and apolipoprotein E genotype ε4 (APOE-ε4) carrier status. Additionally, mediation effects were assessed using causal mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations. RESULTS: In total subjects, VVs had negative correlations with CSF Aβ(42) (β = -0.157, p = 0.038) and CSF Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio (β = -0.272, p < 0.001), as well as positive correlations with CSF Aβ(40) (β = 0.170, p = 0.024), CSF p-tau (β = 0.192, p = 0.008), CSF t-tau/Aβ(42) ratio (β = 0.190, p = 0.011), and CSF p-tau/Aβ(42) ratio (β = 0.248, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex, education levels and APOE-ε4 carrier status. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the relations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers were more significant in female, mid-life adults (40-65 years), less-educated individuals and APOE-ε4 non-carriers. Moreover, CSF Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio might be a partial mediator of the association between VVs and p-tau pathology. CONCLUSION: Our study found correlations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers, suggesting that VVs may be a potential risk factor for the development of AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39791216,Predicting cognitive decline from neuropsychiatric symptoms and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: A machine learning approach to a population-based data.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the potential added value of including neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in machine learning (ML) models, along with demographic features and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, to predict decline or non-decline in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of adding NPS to AD biomarkers on ML model accuracy in predicting cognitive decline among older adults. METHODS: The study was conducted in the setting of the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, including participants aged ≥ 50 years with information on demographics (i.e., age, sex, education), NPS (i.e., Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire; Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories), at least one AD biomarker (i.e., plasma-, neuroimaging- and/or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]-derived), and at least 2 repeated neuropsychological assessments. We trained and tested ML models using a stepwise feature addition approach to predict decline versus non-decline in global and domain-specific (i.e., memory, language, visuospatial, and attention/executive function) cognitive scores. RESULTS: ML models had better performance when NPS were included along with a) neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting decline in global cognition, as well as language and visuospatial skills; b) plasma-derived biomarkers for predicting decline in visuospatial skills; and c) CSF-derived biomarkers for predicting decline in attention/executive function, language, and memory. CONCLUSIONS: NPS, added to ML models including demographic and AD biomarker data, improves prediction of downward trajectories in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults, albeit effect sizes are small. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed by future cohort studies.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
40406128,Artificial intelligence and omics-based autoantibody profiling in dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a neurodegenerative syndrome marked by the accumulation of disease-specific proteins and immune dysregulation, including autoimmune mechanisms involving autoantibodies. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, time-consuming, or costly. METHODS: This study explores the use of proteome-wide autoantibody screening (PWAbS) for noninvasive dementia diagnosis by analyzing serum samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and age-matched cognitively normal individuals (CNIs). Serum samples from 35 subjects were analyzed utilizing our original wet protein arrays displaying more than 13,000 human proteins. RESULTS: PWAbS revealed elevated gross autoantibody levels in AD and DLB patients compared to CNIs. A total of 229 autoantibodies were differentially elevated in AD and/or DLB, effectively distinguishing between patient groups. Machine learning models showed high accuracy in classifying AD, DLB, and CNIs. Gene ontology analysis highlighted autoantibodies targeting neuroactive ligands/receptors in AD and lipid metabolism proteins in DLB. Notably, autoantibodies targeting neuropeptide B (NPB) and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F5 (ADGRF5) showed significant correlations with clinical traits including Mini Mental State Examination scores. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates the potential of PWAbS and artificial intelligence integration as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for dementia, uncovering biomarkers that could enhance understanding of disease mechanisms. Limitations include demographic differences, small sample size, and lack of external validation. Future research should involve longitudinal observation in larger, diverse cohorts and functional studies to clarify autoantibodies' roles in dementia pathogenesis and their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.",Frontiers in immunology
39541539,Affliction class moderates the dementing impact of adipokines.,"OBJECTIVE: Biomarker-specific interventions (e.g., for dementia) will necessitate an individualized approach to treatment. We have constructed a psychometric classifier to identify persons adversely impacted by plasma adipokines. METHOD: The subjects (N = 1,737) of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assigned to groups ""afflicted"" by versus ""resilient"" against the unique effect of plasma adipokines using a classifier derived by confirmatory factor analysis in a structural equation model framework. The impact of affliction class above and beyond observed biomarker levels and covariates was tested by multivariate regression using CDR ""Sum of Boxes"" as the dependent variable. The affliction class' moderation of adipokines' effect was tested by chi-square difference. The effect of affliction class on prospective conversion risk was tested by Cox's proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Seven hundred four out of the 1,737 subjects (40.53%) were assigned to the afflicted class. The afflicted subjects had greater dementia severity, lower (adverse) Adipokines factor composite scores (by analysis of variance, F(1, 1,735) 2619.68, p < .001) and higher observed levels of plasma adipokines (by Tukey's honestly significant difference test, all p < .001). Adipokines' association with dementia severity was moderated by affliction class. The effect persisted at 48 months. Afflicted cases were more likely to convert to Alzheimer's disease in that timeframe, by Cox's F: F(234, 286) = 3.89, p < .001. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach could guide precision interventions against specific biomarkers. This classifier could be administered by telephone, making class assignment feasible without direct patient contact or biomarker assessment.

40443709,The translational power of Alzheimer's-based organoid models in personalized medicine: an integrated biological and digital approach embodying patient clinical history.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by a multifaceted interplay of genetic, environmental, and pathological factors. Traditional diagnostic and research methods, including neuropsychological assessments, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, have advanced our understanding but remain limited by late-stage detection and challenges in modeling disease progression. The emergence of three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids (BOs) offers a transformative platform for bridging these gaps. BOs derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) mimic the structural and functional complexities of the human brain. This advancement offers an alternative or complementary approach for studying AD pathology, including β-amyloid and tau protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and aging processes. By integrating biological complexity with cutting-edge technological tools such as organ-on-a-chip systems, microelectrode arrays, and artificial intelligence-driven digital twins (DTs), it is hoped that BOs will facilitate real-time modeling of AD progression and response to interventions. These models capture central nervous system biomarkers and establish correlations with peripheral markers, fostering a holistic understanding of disease mechanisms. Furthermore, BOs provide a scalable and ethically sound alternative to animal models, advancing drug discovery and personalized therapeutic strategies. The convergence of BOs and DTs potentially represents a significant shift in AD research, enhancing predictive and preventive capacities through precise in vitro simulations of individual disease trajectories. This approach underscores the potential for personalized medicine, reducing the reliance on invasive diagnostics while promoting early intervention. As research progresses, integrating sporadic and familial AD models within this framework promises to refine our understanding of disease heterogeneity and drive innovations in treatment and care.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience
39913635,"The impact of apolipoprotein E, type ∊4 allele on Alzheimer's disease pathological biomarkers: a comprehensive post-mortem pilot-analysis.","The apolipoprotein E type ∊4 allele (ApoE4) is known as the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Meanwhile, many aspects of its impact on AD pathology remain underexplored. This study conducts a systematic data analysisof donor data from the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas. Our investigation delves into the intricate interplay between identified biomarkers and their correlation with ApoE4 across all severities of AD. Employing Pearson R correlation, and one-way and two-way ANOVA tests, we elucidate the pathological changes in biomarkers and the altering effects of ApoE4. Remarkably, the phosphorylation of tau observed in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) marked by the AT8 antibody, emerges as the most correlated factor with other pathological biomarkers. This correlation is mediated by both tau and amyloid pathology, suggesting a higher hierarchical role in determining AD pathological effects than other biomarkers. However, non-ApoE4 carriers exhibit a more significant correlation with disease progression severity compared to ApoE4 carriers, though ApoE4 carriers demonstrate significance in exacerbating the effect of accumulating phosphorylated tau and amyloid plaques assessed by AT8 and 6E10 antibodies. Furthermore, our analysis does not observe dramatic neuronal changes in grey matter across the span of AD pathology. Glia activation, measured by Iba1 and GFAP, demonstrates an amyloid-specific correlation. This research marks the first human post-mortem analysis providing a comprehensive examination of prevailing AD biomarkers and their interconnectedness with pathology and ApoE4 genetic factor. Limitations in the study are acknowledged, underscoring the need for further exploration and refinement in future research endeavors.",PloS one
40286336,Identification of HIBCH and MGME1 as Mitochondrial Dynamics-Related Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease Via Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.,"Mitochondrial dynamics (MD) play a crucial role in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying MD dysregulation in AD remain unclear. This study aimed to identify critical molecules of MD that contribute to AD progression using GEO data and bioinformatics approaches. The GSE63061 dataset comparing AD patients with healthy controls was analysed, WGCNA was employed to identify co-expression modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and LASSO model was developed and verified using the DEGs to screen for potential biomarkers. A PPI network was built to predict upstream miRNAs, which were experimentally validated using luciferase reporter assays. A total of 3518 DEGs were identified (2209 upregulated, 1309 downregulated; |log(2)FC| > 1.5, adjusted p < 0.05). WGCNA revealed 160 MD-related genes. LASSO regression selected HIBCH and MGME1 as novel biomarkers with significant downregulation in AD (fold change > 2, p < 0.001). KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted pathways associated with neurodegeneration. Luciferase assays confirmed direct binding of miR-922 to the 3'UTR of MGME1. HIBCH and MGME1 are promising diagnostic biomarkers for AD with AUC values of 0.73 and 0.74. Mechanistically, miR-922 was experimentally validated to directly bind MGME1 3'UTR.",IET systems biology
39732514,Cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories of subjective cognitive decline according to baseline biomarkers: Results of the CoSCo study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now diagnosed biologically. Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may indicate preclinical AD, assessing AD-biomarkers is crucial. We investigated cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories in SCD over 24 months based on biomarker positivity, and evaluated the predictive value of plasma biomarkers. METHODS: The CoSCo prospective cohort included older adults with SCD. Participants were categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ] 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to compare outcomes. RESULTS: High-risk SCDs (n = 23, 23%) revealed greater decline in general cognition, memory recall, frontal function, and hippocampal volumes compared to low-risk SCDs. Combined scores of plasma and MRIs yielded the best predictions compared with other biomarker categories. DISCUSSION: SCD participants with high-risk experience faster cognitive and neurodegenerative declines. A combination of plasma biomarkers and MRIs could be used for screening and prognosis. HIGHLIGHTS: This is part of a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea. We investigated cognitive and atrophic trajectories in SCD over 24 months. High risk SCDs revealed greater cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. Integration of plasma and MRIs yielded better predictions than other categories. Risk stratification using plasma and MRIs can be used for screening and prognosis.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39890535,The associations between fresh vegetable and fruit consumption and plasma and PET biomarkers in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study of Chinese population.,"BACKGROUND: The identification of the modifiable lifestyle factors including dietary habits in older adults of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and early effective interventions are of great importance. OBJECTIVES: We studied whether the consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits was different between cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) population and mainly investigated the associations between vegetable and fruit consumption and PET and plasma AD biomarkers in older CU adults with higher β-amyloid (Aβ) burden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Older adults with the age of 50-85 years were enrolled for a cross-sectional and longitudinal study. The groups depended on whether the participants were CU or CI. Partial participants whose habits remained unchanged were followed up. MEASUREMENTS: The consumption data of vegetables and fruits were collected using a validated self-reported questionnaire. We mainly investigated the associations between vegetable and fruit consumption and various biomarkers in CU participants with positive (18)F-florbetapir PET scan (Aβ-PET), part of whom also underwent plasma AD biomarkers tests and (18)F-MK6240 PET scan (tau-PET). Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between vegetable and fruit consumption and AD biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 1433 participants were enrolled, of which CU accounted for 49.4 %. Most of the intake habits of vegetables and fruits was different between CU and CI participants. 177 CU participants with Aβ-PET positive were selected for the following study. Multiple linear regression analysis showed higher consumption of fresh vegetables (>200 g/d), dark vegetables (>100 g/d, ≥2d/week), fruits (>100 g/d), berries (>100 g/d) and grapes (>100 g/d) more or less had associations with the plasma biomarkers including Aβ40, t-Tau, p-Tau-181 and neurofilament light chain as well as amyloid and Tau PET biomarkers. Most of the habits were associated with the change of cognitive function after an approximately two-year follow-up. Especially, higher intakes of fruits and grapes correlated with both lower Aβ and Tau burden and inversely with cognitive decline after follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our data indicates that higher consumption of vegetables, dark vegetables, fruits, berries and grapes is associated with amyloid and Tau PET and plasma biomarkers in preclinical AD participants and the changes of cognitive function after follow-up. Higher intakes of fruits (>100 g/d) and grapes (>100 g/d) may be more helpful for reducing the risk of AD development.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39837806,Rapid Recognition and Monitoring of Multiple Core Biomarkers with Point-of-Care Importance through Combinatorial DNA Logic Operation.,"The early diagnosis of a disease relies on the reliable identification and quantitation of multiple core biomarkers in real-time point-of-care (POC) testing. To date, most of the multiplex photoelectrochemical (PEC) assays are inaccessible to home healthcare due to cumbersome steps, long testing time, and limited detection efficiency. The rapid and fast-response generation of independent photocurrent for multiple targets is still a great challenge. Herein, a combinatorial DNA logic operation-guided multiplex PEC sensor is constructed to facilely distinguish and simultaneously monitor two core biomarkers that are essential for identifying asymptomatic Alzheimer patients and predicting the progression of the disease. The aptamers of amyloid-β oligomers (AβO) and Tau(441) protein are simply integrated at the high-performance In-TBAPy photocathode. In the presence of AβO and Tau(441) protein, the aptamer-target affinity complexes are formed and subsequently detached from the electrode surface, resulting in an increase of photocurrent. Through programming concatenated DNA molecular circuits, a 2-target input OR logic gate not only simplifies the manufacturing process of the multiplex PEC sensor but also realizes rapid and intelligent multiple-target recognition. As a conceptual prototype for the development of more sophisticated and complicated logic devices, the proposed DNA molecular logic system may open a new horizon for rapid disease diagnosis and POC analysis.",Analytical chemistry
39875978,Alzheimer's disease: an integrative bioinformatics and machine learning analysis reveals glutamine metabolism-associated gene biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a hallmark of age-related cognitive decline, is defined by its unique neuropathology. Metabolic dysregulation, particularly involving glutamine (Gln) metabolism, has emerged as a critical but underexplored aspect of AD pathophysiology, representing a significant gap in our current understanding of the disease. METHODS: To investigate the involvement of GlnMgs in AD, we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. We began by identifying differentially expressed GlnMgs from a curated list of 34 candidate genes. Subsequently, we employed GSEA and GSVA to assess the biological significance of these GlnMgs. Advanced techniques such as Lasso regression and SVM-RFE were utilized to identify key hub genes and evaluate the diagnostic potential of 14 central GlnMgs in AD. Additionally, we examined their correlations with clinical parameters and validated their expression across multiple independent AD cohorts (GSE5281, GSE37263, GSE106241, GSE132903, GSE63060). RESULTS: Our rigorous analysis identified 14 GlnMgs-GLS2, GLS, GLUD2, GLUL, GOT1, HAL, AADAT, PFAS, ASNSD1, PPAT, NIT2, ALDH5A1, ASRGL1, and ATCAY-as potential contributors to AD pathogenesis. These genes were implicated in vital biological processes, including lipid transport and the metabolism of purine-containing compounds, in response to nutrient availability. Notably, these GlnMgs demonstrated significant diagnostic potential, highlighting their utility as both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovers 14 GlnMgs with potential links to AD, expanding our understanding of the disease's molecular underpinnings and offering promising avenues for biomarker development. These findings not only enhance the molecular landscape of AD but also pave the way for future diagnostic and therapeutic innovations, potentially reshaping AD diagnostics and patient care.",BMC pharmacology & toxicology
39382682,Exploration of plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease by targeted lipid metabolomics based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, but the disease lacks convenient and cost-effective alternative biomarkers currently. We utilized targeted lipid metabolomics based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify plasma biomarkers in AD patients. Our study was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 58 AD patients and 40 matched health controls (HCs). Firstly, we identified plasma lipid metabolites that were significantly different between the two groups based on P < 0.05 and variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 1. Then we examined the correlation between the lipid metabolites and cognitive function using partial correlation analysis and assessed the diagnostic ability of the lipid metabolites using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Seventeen lipoproteins showed significant differences between AD patients and HCs among 114 lipid metabolites. All 17 lipoproteins were subtypes of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Among them, LDL-3 particle number, LDL-3 apolipoprotein-B, LDL-3 phospholipids, LDL free cholesterol and LDL phospholipids were significantly correlated with cognitive function. The ROC curves showed that LDL-2 triglycerides (TG) and LDL-3 TG could significantly distinguish AD patients from HCs, with the area under the curve (AUC) above 0.7. In addition, we explored a strategy of combined diagnosis that significantly improved the diagnostic efficacy for AD (AUC = 0.879). Our study provides insight into the lipoprotein alterations associated with AD and potential biomarkers for its diagnosis and cognitive function assessment.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)"
39825168,Association between inflammatory biomarkers and the cognitive response to a multidomain intervention: secondary longitudinal analyses from the MAPT study.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of systemic inflammation measured by plasma biomarkers with the change in cognitive function among participants from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) exposed to the multidomain intervention (MI). Secondary analysis of the MAPT longitudinal data. MAPT is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 3 interventional groups (omega-3 only, MI only, omega-3 plus MI) and a control group. We tested the association of the change in cognitive function with inflammatory biomarkers (tumoral necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15), Interleukin-6 (IL6) and C reactive protein (CRP)) using mixed-effects models. A subgroup analysis was performed in those exposed to the MI. The response to the MI was defined as the change in the composite cognitive score over the 2-year clinical follow-up period. by modeling the response to the intervention and identifying ""good responders"", i.e., those in the 5th quintile of response at the end of the intervention period (2 years after the measurement of inflammatory markers). We included 1,527 participants (mean age 75.3, SD = 4.4; 64% female). Higher levels of GDF15 and TNFR1 were associated with a worse trajectory in the cognitive composite score in adjusted models. ""Good responders"" had an estimated mean change in the composite score of 0.051 (SD 0.062) over two years of intervention, compared to -0.136 (SD = 0.111) for the ""not-good responders"". Higher IL6 levels were associated with a decreased likelihood of being a ""good responder"" (OR = 0.22, p = 0.018, 95% CI 0.06; 0.78), with similar results for CRP (OR = 0.48, p = 0.009, 95% CI 0.28; 0.84). Higher inflammation was associated with a worse cognitive trajectory among nondemented participants and a lower likelihood of being classified as a ""good responder"" in those receiving a MI. Further confirmation of these findings could lead to the use of systemic inflammation as inclusion or stratification criteria in prevention trials.",GeroScience
39742695,The effect of Amyloid and Tau Co-pathology on disease progression in Lewy body dementia: A systematic review.,"Co-morbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (amyloid-beta and tau) is commonly observed in Lewy body dementia (LBD), and this may affect clinical outcomes. A systematic review of the effect of AD co-pathology on longitudinal clinical outcomes in LBD was conducted. A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (October 2024) yielded n = 3558 records that were screened by two independent reviewers. Included studies (n = 31) assessed AD co-pathology in LBD by neuropathologic examination (n = 10), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (n = 7), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 8) or plasma biomarkers (n = 6); and reported longitudinal clinical outcomes including cognitive and functional decline, mortality, or treatment response. Most neuropathology, PET and plasma studies reviewed demonstrated poorer prognosis in LBD + compared to LBD-, but discrepant findings were seen among CSF studies. No included study reported better outcomes in LBD+. The risk of bias was assessed with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. All studies rated as low risk of bias (n = 12) reported that the presence of AD co-pathology in LBD (LBD+) was associated with accelerated cognitive decline (n = 7/7), accelerated functional decline (n = 3/3), greater mortality (n = 2/2) and poorer response to treatment (n = 1/1). Among these studies, LBD+ was associated with an additional decline of -0.53 to -2.9 MMSE points/year compared to LBD-, while one study reported an adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in LBD + as 3.70. We conclude that AD co-pathology is associated with worse clinical outcomes in LBD whether assessed by greater cognitive decline, increased mortality or greater decline on functional assessment scales.",Parkinsonism & related disorders
39835816,Multiple-Signal Amplification Strategy to Fabricate an Ultrasensitive Electrochemiluminescence Magnetic Immunosensor for Detecting Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease via Iridium-Based Self-Enhancing Nanoemitters.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, significantly impairing the daily life of elderly individuals. The low abundance of blood-based biomarkers in AD necessitates higher analytical technique requirements. Herein, one novel iridium-based ECL self-enhanced nanoemitter (TPrA@Ir-SiO(2)) was unprecedentedly reported, and it was further used to construct an ultrasensitive ECL magnetic immunosensor by a multiple-signal amplification strategy to unequally sensitively and accurately detect the AD blood-based biomarker (P-tau181) in this work. The initial signal amplification was accomplished via incorporating a new efficient iridium-based luminophore named Ir(mdq)(2)(acac) and a corresponding coreactant into silica nanoparticles to successfully obtain TPrA@Ir-SiO(2). In addition, the specific and high-affinity interactions between streptavidin and biotin were subsequently employed to further facilitate signal amplification. Based on the advantages of the luminophore itself and the high-affinity interactions between biotin and streptavidin, the corresponding ECL immunosensor proposed in this work exhibited remarkable sensitivity, covering a wide linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 0.1 μg/mL, and achieved an ultralow limit of detection of 68.58 fg/mL (S/N = 3), and it also exhibited outstanding recovery (98-104%) and RSD (1.92-4.86%) in the detection of serum samples by the spiking method. These remarkable results undoubtedly demonstrate the potential of self-enhanced ECL nanoemitters combined with a synergistic signal amplification strategy bearing streptavidin-biotin in detecting AD blood-based biomarkers, providing accurate and reliable solutions for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD, which would open a new avenue to effectively reduce the burden on AD patients' families and society in the future.",ACS sensors
39631655,The emerging roles of particulate matter-changed non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: A comprehensive in silico analysis and review.,"Research on epigenetic‒environmental interactions in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has accelerated rapidly in recent decades. Numerous studies have demonstrated the contribution of ambient particulate matter (PM) to the onset of AD. Emerging evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, and microRNAs, play a role in the pathophysiology of AD. In this review, we provide an overview of PM-altered ncRNAs in the brain, with emphasis on their potential roles in the pathogenesis of AD. These results suggest that these PM-altered ncRNAs are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta pathology, microtubule-associated protein Tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction, damage to the blood‒brain barrier, microglial dysfunction, dysmyelination, and neuronal loss. In addition, we utilized in silico analysis to explore the biological functions of PM-altered ncRNAs in the development of AD. This review summarizes the knowns and unknowns of PM-altered ncRNAs in AD pathogenesis and discusses the current dilemma regarding PM-altered ncRNAs as promising biomarkers of AD. Altogether, this is the first thorough review of the connection between PM exposure and ncRNAs in AD pathogenesis, which may offer novel insights into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD associated with ambient PM exposure.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)"
39868506,An unsupervised learning approach for clustering joint trajectories of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: An application to ADNI Data.,"INTRODUCTION: Current models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression assume a common pattern and pathology, oversimplifying the heterogeneity of clinical AD. METHODS: We define a syndrome as a unique biomarker progression pattern and develop a lag measure to cluster pre-dementia individuals, reflecting their pathology's multi-dimensionality. The technique uses the time-ordering of events to group individuals based on their position along the disease process and the relative positions of their markers. RESULTS: An application using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data highlights the need for our novel approach to clustering individuals into syndrome groups. DISCUSSION: Accurately characterizing biomarker curves associated with brain damage requires an initial step that groups individuals on a syndrome basis, accounting for the heterogeneity of underlying pathologies in clinical AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Developed a novel distance measure and clustering approach for AD biomarker trajectories. Identified distinct subgroups with different biomarker progression patterns in ADNI data. Findings challenge the traditional amyloid cascade hypothesis and suggest AD heterogeneity. Clustering approach accounts for shifts in time and emphasizes progression patterns. Results have implications for AD diagnosis, targeted interventions, and clinical trials.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39118434,PTSD moderates the association between subjective cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in older veterans.,"OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are independent risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, but the association of their interaction on AD biomarkers have yet to be characterized. This study aimed to examine the impact of PTSD on the association between SCD and tau and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) as well as global cognition in older Veterans. METHOD: This study included 87 Vietnam-Era Veterans without dementia (42 with PTSD; 45 without PTSD) from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All participants had both tau and amyloid PET imaging as well as cognitive testing. SCD was measured using the Everyday Cognition questionnaire. RESULTS: While SCD was associated with tau PET, amyloid PET, and global cognition, PTSD moderated these associations for tau and amyloid PET levels. Specifically, Veterans without PTSD had a stronger positive relationship between SCD and AD biomarkers when compared to those with PTSD. CONCLUSION: Higher SCD was associated with greater tau and amyloid burden and worse cognitive performance across the sample, though the tau and amyloid associations were stronger for Veterans without PTSD. Results highlight the potential benefit of comprehensive clinical assessments including consideration of mental health among older Veterans with SCD to understand the underlying cause of the cognitive concerns. Additionally, more work is needed to understand alternative mechanisms driving SCD in older Veterans with PTSD.",Aging & mental health
39869613,Alzheimer's disease image classification based on enhanced residual attention network.,"With the increasing number of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the demand for early diagnosis and intervention is becoming increasingly urgent. The traditional detection methods for Alzheimer's disease mainly rely on clinical symptoms, biomarkers, and imaging examinations. However, these methods have limitations in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease, such as strong subjectivity in diagnostic criteria, high detection costs, and high misdiagnosis rates. To address these issues, this study proposes a deep learning model to detect Alzheimer's disease; it is called Enhanced Residual Attention Network (ERAN) that can classify medical images. By combining residual learning, attention mechanism, and soft thresholding, the feature representation ability and classification accuracy of the model have been improved. The accuracy of the model in detecting Alzheimer's disease has reached 99.36%, with a loss rate of only 0.0264. The experimental results indicate that the Enhanced Residual Attention Network has achieved excellent performance on the Alzheimer's disease test dataset, providing strong support for the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",PloS one
39637673,A multimodal Neuroimaging-Based risk score for mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent age-related dementia, leads to significant cognitive decline. While genetic risk factors and neuroimaging biomarkers have been extensively studied, establishing a neuroimaging-based metric to assess AD risk has received less attention. This study introduces the Brain-wide Risk Score (BRS), a novel approach using multimodal neuroimaging data to assess the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. METHODS: Participants from the OASIS-3 cohort (N = 1,389) were categorized into control (CN) and MCI groups. Structural MRI (sMRI) data provided gray matter (GM) segmentation maps, while resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data yielded functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices via spatially constrained independent component analysis. Similar imaging features were computed from the UK Biobank (N = 37,780). The BRS was calculated by comparing each participant's neuroimaging features to the difference between average features of CN and MCI groups. Both GM and FNC features were used. The BRS effectively differentiated CN from MCI individuals within OASIS-3 and in an independent dataset from the ADNI cohort (N = 729), demonstrating its ability to identify MCI risk. RESULTS: Unimodal analysis revealed that sMRI provided greater differentiation than fMRI, consistent with prior research. Using the multimodal BRS, we identified two distinct groups: one with high MCI risk (negative GM and FNC BRS) and another with low MCI risk (positive GM and FNC BRS). Additionally, 46 UK Biobank participants diagnosed with AD showed FNC and GM patterns similar to the high-risk groups. CONCLUSION: Validation using the ADNI dataset confirmed our results, highlighting the potential of FNC and sMRI-based BRS in early Alzheimer's detection.",NeuroImage. Clinical
39853853,Polygenic risk discriminates Lewy body dementia from Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Lewy body dementia (LBD) shares genetic risk factors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including apolipoprotein E (APOE), but is distinguishable at the genome-wide level. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may therefore improve diagnostic classification. METHODS: We assessed diagnostic classification using AD-PRS excluding APOE (AD-PRS(no) (APOE)), APOE risk score (APOE-RS), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), in 83 participants with LBD, 27 with positron emission tomography amyloid beta (Aβ)positive mild cognitive impairment or AD (MCI+/AD), and 57 controls. RESULTS: Together AD-PRS(no) (APOE) and APOE-RS performed similarly to p-tau181 in discriminating MCI+/AD from controls (area under the curve 76% vs. 79%) and LBD (71% vs. 72%). In LBD, Aβ positivity was significantly associated with APOE-RS, but not with AD-PRS(no) (APOE), or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS(no) (APOE), APOE-RS, and p-tau181 improved the discrimination of MCI+/AD from controls (81%) and LBD (75%), and the detection of Aβ in LBD (82%). DISCUSSION: Aβ deposition in LBD was associated with APOE, while MCI+/AD was also associated with AD-PRS beyond APOE. AD-PRS explains phenotypic variance not captured by APOE or p-tau181. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score (PRS), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) to classify AD and Lewy body dementia (LBD). AD-PRS with APOE achieved similar classification accuracy to p-tau181. AD-PRS without APOE significantly contributed to discriminating AD from LBD. Amyloid beta positivity in LBD was associated with APOE but not AD-PRS without APOE or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS, APOE, and p-tau181 improved diagnostic classification accuracy.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39849395,Enhanced detection of mild cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease: a hybrid model integrating dual biomarkers and advanced machine learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and memory loss. Early diagnosis is the most effective strategy to slow the disease's progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is frequently viewed as a crucial stage before the onset of AD, making it the ideal period for therapeutic intervention. AD is marked by the buildup of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are believed to cause neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Both Aβ plaques and NFTs accumulate for many years before the clinical symptoms become apparent in AD. As a result, in this study, CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF) biomarker information is combined with hippocampal volumes to differentiate between MCI and AD. For this, a novel two-stage hybrid learning model that leverages 3D CNN and the notion of a Fuzzy and Machine learning model is proposed. A 3D-CNN architecture is employed to segment the hippocampus from the structural brain 3D-MR images and quantify the hippocampus volume. In stage 1, the hippocampus volume is passed through thirteen machine learning models and fuzzy clustering for classifying symptomatic AD and healthy brain (Normal Control - NC). The CSF data is fuzzified to capture the inherent uncertainty and overlap in clinical data. The identified symptomatic AD data in the stage1 are further classified into MCI and AD with the aid of a fuzzified CSF biomarker in stage 2. The experimental work presented in this study utilized the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The proposed hybrid model achieved an average accuracy of 93.6% for distinguishing between NC and symptomatic AD and 93.7% for discriminating between MCI and AD. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and provides a more comprehensive assessment, allowing for earlier and more targeted therapeutic interventions.",BMC geriatrics
40297670,Prospecting salivary tau as a diagnostic for Alzheimer's type dementia.,"Although recognized as one of the most critical and prevalent dementias, Alzheimer's disease (AD) still does not have an affirmative biological marker, being diagnosed by excluding other pathologies that present similar symptoms. In the last decade, advances have been made in researching pathophysiological phenomena related to AD, with the identification of probable biomarkers. Some of these substances have a direct action on the degenerative activity that involves AD and may be associated with other pathological processes, such as inflammation and diabetes. OBJECTIVE: These occurrences led us to investigate further whether the levels of certain substances may be associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Biomarkers can be found in plasma, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS: This project investigated tau protein as a possible salivary biomarker in 76 patients, control group and Alzheimer's, with different age groups, to establish a positive correlation between the studied biomarker and AD. RESULTS: Our findings showed that phosphorylated tau (pTAU) concentrations are higher in AD patients and somewhat lower in elderly patients without Alzheimer's, but in young patients without Alzheimer's the levels are much lower. Total tau had very similar levels in three groups evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we believe in the possibility of using saliva as an auxiliary method in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, with the advantages of low cost, non-invasiveness, and ease of collection. Still, more investigations will be needed to confirm this method presented.",Dementia & neuropsychologia

39610287,Meaning in life and neurobiomarkers of brain health in the UK Biobank.,"This study examines meaning in life and four neurobiomarkers implicated in dementia risk: amyloid-β 42 to 40 ratio, phosphorylated tau-181, neurofilament light, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Adults without dementia (N = 1150; M(age )= 59.89) from the UK Biobank reported their meaning in life; neurobiomarkers were assayed twice. Meaning in life was unrelated to the biomarkers at either assessment (βs range -0.03-0.02). No association was moderated by age. These findings do not support the hypothesis that meaning in life is associated with neurobiomarkers in adults without dementia. The relation between meaning and cognition may be through other pathways, such as resilience to neuropathology.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39825947,Alterations of amino acids in older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia.,"Metabolomics provide a promising tool for understanding dementia pathogenesis and identifying novel biomarkers. This study aimed to identify amino acid biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Vascular Dementia (VD). By amino acid metabolomics, the concentrations of amino acids were determined in the serum of AD and VD patients as well as age-matched healthy controls. Several differences in the concentration of amino acids were observed in AD patients compared to both healthy controls and VD patients. However, no significant distinction was found between healthy controls and VD patients. Considering comorbidities, cystine levels were higher in AD than in VD among non-diabetic patients, but not in those with diabetes. Notably, creatine, spermidine, cystine, and tyrosine demonstrated favorable results in decision curve analyses and good discriminative performances, suggesting their potential for clinical application. These fundings give novel perspectives of serum amino acids for predicting metabolic pathways in AD and VD pathogenesis.",Amino acids
39830185,ReIU: an efficient preliminary framework for Alzheimer patients based on multi-model data.,"The rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to traditional diagnostic methods, which primarily rely on neuropsychological assessments and brain MRIs.

Our method achieved segmentation accuracies of 79.1% on the DRIVE dataset, 68.3% on the HRF dataset. Utilizing a multimodal dataset comprising both healthy and AD subjects, ReIU extracted vascular density from fundus images, facilitating primary AD screening with a classification accuracy of 79%. These results demonstrate ReIU's substantial accuracy and its potential as an economical, non-invasive screening tool for Alzheimer's disease.

39042528,Multi-Modal Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Interpretable Graph Convolutional Networks.,"The interconnection between brain regions in neurological disease encodes vital information for the advancement of biomarkers and diagnostics. Although graph convolutional networks are widely applied for discovering brain connection patterns that point to disease conditions, the potential of connection patterns that arise from multiple imaging modalities has yet to be fully realized. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal sparse interpretable GCN framework (SGCN) for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our experimentation, SGCN learned the sparse regional importance probability to find signature regions of interest (ROIs), and the connective importance probability to reveal disease-specific brain network connections. We evaluated SGCN on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with multi-modal brain images and demonstrated that the ROI features learned by SGCN were effective for enhancing AD status identification. The identified abnormalities were significantly correlated with AD-related clinical symptoms. We further interpreted the identified brain dysfunctions at the level of large-scale neural systems and sex-related connectivity abnormalities in AD/MCI. The salient ROIs and the prominent brain connectivity abnormalities interpreted by SGCN are considerably important for developing novel biomarkers. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the network-based disorder via multi-modal diagnosis and offer the potential for precision diagnostics.

39995657,"Neuronal and glial dysfunction, white matter hyperintensities and cognition in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.","This cross-sectional study examined associations between multiple fluid biomarkers of neuronal and glial dysfunction (plasma neurofilament light chain, CSF growth-associated protein 43 and CSF soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), total white matter hyperintensity volume and episodic memory and executive function performance in the context of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status. A total of 563 participants (mean age = 71.9 years, standard deviation = 7.2) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were classified by the amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration framework into no Alzheimer's disease pathology (n = 176), suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (n = 87) or Alzheimer's disease continuum (n = 300) groups. Participants completed baseline neuropsychological assessment, plasma/CSF biomarker collection and MRI. Analyses explored the relative contributions of biomarkers to episodic memory and executive function performance and whether relationships varied by amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration group status. Across all participants, neurofilament light chain ( β^ = -0.14, P < 0.001) and growth-associated protein 43 ( β^ = -0.13, P < 0.001) were the strongest biomarkers associated with episodic memory performance, such that greater levels were associated with worse episodic memory. There was a group by growth-associated protein 43 interaction with episodic memory: greater growth-associated protein 43 was associated with lower episodic memory performance in participants classified as Alzheimer's disease continuum relative to the no Alzheimer's disease pathology group ( β^ = -0.26, P < 0.001). No robust associations between biomarkers and executive function performance or between soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, white matter hyperintensity volume and cognition were observed. Biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury and synaptic dysfunction may independently contribute to episodic memory performance across participants with differing amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration profiles. Growth-associated protein 43 may predict worse episodic memory performance in participants with greater Alzheimer's disease pathology. These biomarkers of neuronal dysfunction may serve as domain-specific cognitive correlates in the context of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status.",Brain communications
39800047,"The investigation of peripheral inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in dementia with Lewy Bodies, compared with Alzheimer's Disease, and mild cognitive impairment.","Although inflammation and oxidative stress have been increasingly recognised as components of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathologies. Few studies have investigated peripheral inflammation, and none have examined oxidative stress in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The purpose of our study was to characterize and compare those biomarkers in DLB with those in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Plasma samples were obtained from Chinese patients with DLB (n = 50), AD (n = 59), and aMCI (n = 30), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 54). Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), were also assessed. The findings revealed that DLB patients had higher IL-6 levels than AD and HCs and elevated IL-10 and IL-17A levels compared to HCs. In terms of oxidative stress, the levels of SOD were significantly lower and MDA were significantly higher in the DLB and AD compared with HCs. Significant positive correlations were found between Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and CRP levels. Our study identifies a unique peripheral immune and oxidative stress profile in DLB, characterized by elevated IL-6, MDA, and reduced SOD levels, distinguishing it from AD. These findings, linked to α-synuclein (α-Syn) pathology, provide novel insights into DLB mechanisms and highlight potential biomarkers for disease monitoring, targeted therapies, and future clinical trials.",Neuroscience
40456092,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia From Electroencephalography Signals.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most burdensome neurodegenerative disorders in older populations as they pose significant challenges because of subtle cognitive decline in the initial stages. This study proposes a novel approach to distinguishing AD, FTD, and cognitively normal (CN) subjects using electroencephalography (EEG) time-domain analysis through Hjorth parameters (Activity, Mobility, and Complexity). By exploring various window lengths and moving lengths to determine the optimal segment where dementia features are most pronounced, the proposed method achieved high classification accuracy across multiple diagnostic categories. Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), the approach attained 92.5% accuracy for AD&FTD/CN classification. In individual group classifications, the method attained 88.6% accuracy for AD/CN using LDA and 96.0% accuracy for FTD/CN using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). AD classification demonstrated 92.6% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity, while FTD classification achieved 85.9% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Furthermore, a significant correlation (r =0.70, ${p} =0.01$ ) was found between Hjorth parameters and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, validating the method's potential for cognitive decline assessment. The optimal time segmentation approach and high classification accuracy represent substantial improvements over existing methods, offering a reliable and interpretable tool for clinical dementia diagnosis. These findings suggest that time-domain analysis using Hjorth parameters could be an effective biomarker for early dementia detection, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a
39818048,Development of multifunctional fluorescence-emitting potential theranostic agents for Alzheimer's disease.,"The cholinergic deficits and amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation are the mainstream simultaneously observed pathologies during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deposited Aβ plaques are considered to be the primary pathological hallmarks of AD and are contemplated as promising diagnostic biomarker. Herein, a series of novel theranostic agents were designed, synthesised and evaluated against cholinesterase (ChEs) enzymes and detection of Aβ species, which are major targets for development of therapeutics for AD. Among all the tested compounds against ChEs enzymes, compound/probe 39 & 43 exhibited potent inhibitory activities. Its excellent BBB permeability was anticipated in PAMPA assay. Measurement of fluorescent properties showed emission maxima (λ(emm)) in between 530 and 550 nm in distinct organic solvent except in the most polar solvent i.e., PBS (10 % DMSO), where broad absorption (λ(abs) of 440 nm) and emission spectrum (λ(emm) of 640 nm) was observed. The relative fluorescence quantum yield of probe 39 in methanol was found to be 0.17. The increase in fluorescence intensity displayed by the probe 39 upon binding with Aβ aggregates in the in vitro assay, and produced high apparent binding constant. Further, it's binding affinity towards Aβ(1-42) aggregates was validated on the basis of colocalization with thioflavin T (ThT). A significant enhancement in the fluorescence lifetime of probe 39 on binding with Aβ aggregates was observed in time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) analysis (10.00 ± 1.12 ns) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) imaging (11.53 ± 0.01 ns). Furthermore, acute oral toxicity studies signified the safety profile of lead probe 39. The in-vivo behavioural studies demonstrated a substantial improvement of cognitive and special memory impairment in the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficit in mice model on the administration of compound 39 at a dose of 20 mg/kg. The AChE inhibitory potential and antioxidant property of lead probe 39 were further accessed with ex vivo biochemical analysis.

40395692,NFκB1: a common biomarker linking Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. The transcription factor NF-κB1 is implicated in both neuroprotective and pro-inflammatory processes, with its activity varying between neurons and glial cells. While previous studies have explored the genetic and epigenetic contributions to these diseases, the infection hypothesis has re-emerged as a potential framework for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We conducted bulk RNA sequencing on human postmortem caudate nucleus tissue samples obtained from cognitively normal controls (n = 5), AD patients (n = 6), and PD patients (n = 3). Differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment were performed to identify dysregulated signaling mechanisms relevant to neuroinflammation and mitochondrial function. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: TNFα signaling through the NF-κB pathway was identified as a prominently dysregulated mechanism in both AD and PD samples. Transcript levels of NFE2L2 (NRF2) and NF-κB1 were elevated, coinciding with reduced expression of the mitochondrial transporter gene SLC25A6, suggesting a compensatory response to oxidative stress. Additionally, PLCG2 expression was markedly increased in microglial populations, reflecting heightened immune activation. A significant 10-fold reduction in hemoglobin subunit alpha (HbA1) RNA was observed in disease groups compared to controls, indicating compromised oxygen transport and cellular stress. These findings highlight candidate biomarkers and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial integrity and neuroinflammation may be effective in AD and PD.",Frontiers in neuroscience
39473253,Fast Declining Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease from Early Clinical Assessment.,"INTRODUCTION: The heterogenicity in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression hinders individual prognosis. The present work is an observational 2-year longitudinal study in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (n = 52, with positive CSF biomarkers). The aim of this study is to predict which patients are at risk of fast progression. For this, 3 neuropsychological tests based on different domains (clinical dementia, cognition, delayed memory) and the sum of them were used. METHODS: The tests were performed at diagnosis time (T1) and two years after the diagnosis time (T2). Then, the corresponding progression models were developed using each individual test and their sum as a variable response. RESULTS: As a result, the model based on cognition status to predict fast decline (differences in the Z score (T2-T1) <1.5 were considered fast declining) provided satisfactory performance (AUC 0.74, 83.3% of sensibility and 70.2% of specificity); the models based on clinical dementia and delayed memory to predict fast declining showed low AUC and sensitivity. Nevertheless, the model based on the sum of the 3 tests showed the highest AUC (0.79), low sensitivity (63.6%), and high specificity. CONCLUSION: The developed progression models could provide useful information to clinicians and AD patients regarding their fast/normal decline in general or specific domains.",Current neuropharmacology

This study aimed to (1) investigate concordance between comparably derived QDRS and CDR global scores, (2) examine item-level QDRS/CDR agreement, and (3) compare sample characteristics and cognitive performance across QDRS/CDR global concordant/discordant groups. METHODS: The study included 351 QDRS/CDR pairs from 297 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Analyses included descriptive indices of QDRS/CDR agreement, lasso logistic regression, tetrachoric correlations, and linear mixed models. RESULTS: The QDRS global/CDR global concordance rate is 70.66%. Memory item discrepancies were primarily responsible for QDRS/CDR global rating discordance. Average cognitive scores were highest in concordant-normal QDRS/CDR and lowest in concordant-abnormal QDRS/CDR. DISCUSSION: The QDRS effectively screened for impairment in this sample. Future analyses will investigate QDRS relations to ADRD biomarkers.

39825484,Blood biomarker profiles in young-onset neurocognitive disorders: A cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Young-onset neurocognitive symptoms result from a heterogeneous group of neurological and psychiatric disorders which present a diagnostic challenge. To identify such factors, we analysed the Biomarkers in Younger-Onset Neurocognitive Disorders cohort, a study of individuals <65 years old presenting with neurocognitive symptoms for a diagnosis and who have undergone cognitive and biomarker analyses. METHODS: Sixty-five participants (median age at assessment of 56 years, 45% female) were recruited during their index presentation to the Royal Melbourne Hospital Neuropsychiatry Centre, a tertiary specialist service in Melbourne, Australia, and categorized as either early-onset Alzheimer's disease (n = 18), non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration (n = 23) or primary psychiatric disorders (n = 24). Levels of neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated-tau 181, apolipoprotein E genotype and late-onset Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores were determined. Information-theoretic model selection identified discriminatory factors. RESULTS: Neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated-tau 181 levels were elevated in early-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with other diagnostic categories. A multi-omic model selection identified that a combination of cognitive and blood biomarkers, but not the polygenic risk score, discriminated between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and primary psychiatric disorders (area under the curve ⩾ 0.975, 95% confidence interval: 0.825-1.000). Phosphorylated-tau 181 alone significantly discriminated between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration causes (area under the curve = 0.950, 95% confidence interval: 0.877-1.00). DISCUSSION: Discriminating between early-onset Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration and primary psychiatric disorders causes of young-onset neurocognitive symptoms is possible by combining cognitive profiles with blood biomarkers. These results support utilizing blood biomarkers for the work-up of young-onset neurocognitive symptoms and highlight the need for the development of a young-onset Alzheimer's disease-specific polygenic risk score.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry
39699875,Multimodal Blood-Based Biomarker Panel Reveals Altered Lysosomal Ionic Content in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and adult neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) share various clinical and pathophysiological features. LSDs are characterized by impaired lysosomal activity caused by mutations in key proteins and enzymes. While lysosomal dysfunction is also linked to AD pathogenesis, its precise role in disease onset or progression remains unclear. Lysosomal ionic homeostasis is recognized as a key feature of many LSDs, but it has not been clinically linked with AD pathology. Thus, investigating whether this regulation is disrupted in AD is important, as it could lead to new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for this multifactorial disease. Here, using two-ion mapping (2-IM) technology, we quantitatively profiled lysosomal pH and Ca(2+) in blood-derived monocytes from AD patients and age-matched controls and correlated lysosome ionicity with age and key markers of AD pathology, namely, amyloid deposits, tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. Together, the data show that the ionic milieu of lysosomes is dysregulated in monocytes of AD patients and correlates with key plasma biomarkers of AD. Using a machine learning model based on the above parameters, we describe a proof-of-concept combinatorial biomarker platform that accurately distinguishes between patients with AD and control participants with an area under the curve of >96%. Our study introduces a convenient, noninvasive platform with the potential to diagnose Alzheimer's disease based on fluid, cellular, and molecular biomarkers. Further, these findings highlight the potential for investigating therapeutic mechanisms capable of restoring lysosome ionic homeostasis to ameliorate AD.",ACS chemical biology
39868827,Natural language processing-based classification of early Alzheimer's disease from connected speech.,"INTRODUCTION: The automated analysis of connected speech using natural language processing (NLP) emerges as a possible biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear which types of connected speech are most sensitive and specific for the detection of AD. METHODS: We applied a language model to automatically transcribed connected speech from 114 Flemish-speaking individuals to first distinguish early AD patients from amyloid negative cognitively unimpaired (CU) and then amyloid negative from amyloid positive CU individuals using five different types of connected speech. RESULTS: The language model was able to distinguish between amyloid negative CU subjects and AD patients with up to 81.9% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity. Discrimination between amyloid positive and negative CU individuals was less accurate, with up to 82.7% sensitivity and 74.0% specificity. Moreover, autobiographical interviews consistently outperformed scene descriptions. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the value of autobiographical interviews for the automated analysis of connecting speech. HIGHLIGHTS: This study compared five types of connected speech for the detection of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autobiographical interviews yielded a higher specificity than scene descriptions. A preceding clinical AD classification task can refine the performance of amyloid status classification in cognitively healthy individuals.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39919860,Fluorescence imaging of homocysteine dynamics: Complementary diagnostic applications in Alzheimer's disease.,"With the continue emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying therapies, pinpointing the treatments that offer the greatest benefits to patients is increasingly critical. Complementary diagnostics are powerful tests that can provide crucial biomarker dynamics about the drug usage that can improve treatment outcomes by individualized pharmacotherapy. Herein, we exploited a robust near-infrared fluorescent probe, by attenuating the pre-twisting tendency and the twist intramolecular charge transfer effect, for sensing of Hcy in vitro and in vivo with high quantum yield, excellent selectivity, and remarkable sensitivity. The probe is capable of monitoring endogenous Hcy dynamics in cells, tissues and in vivo with exceptional blood-brain barrier permeability. Specifically, we revealed that Hcy can contribute to the onset and development of AD by facilitating the formation of amyloid-β aggregates, elucidating the intricate relationship between brain Hcy levels and AD progression. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of four licensed drugs on endogenous marker Hcy dynamics in cells and in mice with AD model. Our study provides a valuable molecular probe platform utilizing Hcy as a biomarker for supplementary diagnosis applications.",Analytica chimica acta

39818939,"Discovery of (3-Phenylcarbamoyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)phosphonates as Imidazoline I(2) Receptor Ligands with Anti-Alzheimer and Analgesic Properties.","Imidazoline I(2) receptors (I(2)-IRs) are altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and are associated with analgesia. I(2)-IRs are not structurally described, and their pharmacological characterization relies on their modulation by highly affine ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis of (3-phenylcarbamoyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)phosphonates endowed with relevant affinities for I(2)-IRs in human brain tissues. The optimal ADME and pharmacokinetic profile of a selected compound, 12d, secured its in vivo exploration in a senescence accelerated prone 8 mice revealing improvement in the cognitive impairment and unveiling the mechanism of action by analyzing specific AD biomarkers. The treatment of a capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity murine model with 12d revealed analgesic properties devoid of motor coordination issues. The target engagement of 12d was demonstrated by suppression of the analgesic effect by pretreatment with idazoxan. Overall, 12d is a putative candidate for advancing preclinical phases and supports the modulation of I(2)-IRs as an innovative approach for therapeutics.",Journal of medicinal chemistry
39754267,Transcriptomic predictors of rapid progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains an unmet need. Thus, identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high-risk of progressing to AD is crucial for early intervention. METHODS: Blood-based transcriptomics analyses were performed using a longitudinal study cohort to compare progressive MCI (P-MCI, n = 28), stable MCI (S-MCI, n = 39), and AD patients (n = 49). Statistical DESeq2 analysis and machine learning methods were employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and develop prediction models. RESULTS: We discovered a remarkable gender-specific difference in DEGs that distinguish P-MCI from S-MCI. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI (AUC 0.93), AD from S-MCI (AUC 0.94), and AD from P-MCI (AUC 0.92). An 8-gene signature was identified for distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Blood-based transcriptomic biomarker signatures show great utility in identifying high-risk MCI patients, with mitochondrial processes emerging as a crucial contributor to AD progression.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
39828771,Serum β-secretase 1 (sBACE1) activity in subjective cognitive decline: an exploratory study.,"β-Secretase-1 (BACE1) plays a key role in the regulation of cerebral amyloid-β homeostasis, being involved in amyloidogenic and, as recently found, amyloidolytic pathways. Growing evidence indicates that increased serum BACE1 (sBACE1) activity might represent an early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in sBACE1 activity may already occur in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). We found that sBACE1 activity was significantly higher in individuals with SCD (n 118) compared to cognitively normal subjects (controls, n 137) (p < 0.001). Moreover, compared with SCD, sBACE1 activity was even higher in patients affected by amnestic (n 179) or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n 99) (p < 0.001 and p 0.02, respectively). In all cases, the respective increase in sBACE1 activity was significant after adjustment for possible confounders including age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found a significant sexual dimorphism, with women affected by either type of MCI, but not by SCD, having higher levels of serum BACE1 activity compared to men. These results provide evidence supporting the potential use of sBACE1 activity as tool for blood-based screening of cognitively healthy individuals at clinical risk of MCI and dementia.",GeroScience
39837812,Developing multifactorial dementia prediction models using clinical variables from cohorts in the US and Australia.,"Existing dementia prediction models using non-neuroimaging clinical measures have been limited in their ability to identify disease. This study used machine learning to re-examine the diagnostic potential of clinical measures for dementia. Data was sourced from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Clinical variables included 21 measures across medical history, hematological and other blood tests, and APOE genotype. Tree-based machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks were used. APOE genotype was the best predictor of dementia cases and healthy controls. Our results, however, demonstrated that there are limitations when using publicly accessible cohort data that may limit the generalizability and interpretability of such predictive models. Future research should examine the use of routine APOE genetic testing for dementia diagnostics. It should also focus on clearly unifying data across clinical cohorts.",Translational psychiatry
40013096,Exploring cognitive and neuroimaging profiles of dementia subtypes of individuals with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"OBJECTIVE: The 2024 Alzheimer's Association (AA) research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) considers fluid biomarkers, including promising blood-based biomarkers for detecting AD. This study aims to identify dementia subtypes and their cognitive and neuroimaging profiles in older adults with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using biomarkers and clinical data. METHODS: Forty-five individuals with dementia over 65 years old were evaluated using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and the informant-based Alzheimer's Questionnaire. Core AD biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and p-tau181) and non-specific neurodegeneration biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) were measured in blood plasma. Neuroimaging structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia subtypes were determined based on plasma biomarker pathology and vascular markers. Biomarker cutoff scores were identified to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Individuals were stratified into one of four dementia subtypes-AD only, non-AD vascular, non-AD other, or mixed - based on combinations of abnormalities in these markers. RESULTS: Among the 45 individuals with dementia, mixed dementia had the highest prevalence (42.4%), followed by AD-only (24.4%), non-AD other dementia (22.2%), and non-AD vascular dementia subtypes (11.1%). Both cognitive and neuroimaging profiles aligned poorly with biomarker classifications in the full sample. Cognitive tests varied across dementia subtypes. The cognitive profile of the AD-only and mixed groups suggested relatively low cognitive performance, while the non-AD and other groups had the best scores on average. CONCLUSION: Consistent with studies in other settings, our preliminary findings suggest that neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers may help to identify dementia subtypes and provide insight into cognitive and neuroimaging profiles among older adults in the DRC.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40421158,Pupillary response test as a potential early diagnosis biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.,"Psychometric tests as the gold-standard for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) tend to be inefficient, nonreproducible, and are affected by many factors. Research on pupillary response in AD is not novel; however, there has not been a single study providing the diagnostic value of pupillary response parameters as a recommendation for their potential use for early AD diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate pupillary response parameters as clinical biomarkers of AD that are dynamic, affordable, efficient, and objective (non-operator dependent). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on pupillary response parameters was conducted, with comparative and correlation-analytical tests between pupillary response and the Mini-Mental State Examination cognitive score. The diagnostic value of pupillary response parameters was obtained by determining the cutoff point of each parameter by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, Youden's maximum index, Area Under the Curve (AUC) value from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Pupillary response parameters were classified into four types: size, response time, velocity, and acceleration. RESULTS: There were 128 respondents in total, consisting of cognitively-unimpaired young adults, cognitively-unimpaired older adults, and cognitively-impaired older adults. The pupillary response values without involving acceleration parameters were reliable. The diagnostic value of change in pupil size, the maximum and the average constriction velocity parameters have normal cognitive cutoff scores of 1.77 mm (sensitivity: 61.3%; specificity: 80%; positive predictive value [PPV]: 47.76%; negative predictive value [NPV]: 86.88%), ≥4.43 mm/s (sensitivity: 70.4%; specificity: 58.5%; PPV: 46.93%; NPV: 78.48%), and 3.12 mm/s (sensitivity: 70.4%; specificity: 55.0%; PPV: 45.83%; NPV: 77.5%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary response, in particular changes in constriction and velocity, can be potentially used as an early diagnostic biomarker for AD.",Dementia & neuropsychologia
39757300,A comprehensive investigation of Clerodendrum Infortunatum Linn. using LC-QTOF-MS/MS metabolomics as a promising anti-alzheimer candidate.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a global health challenge, demanding innovative approaches for effective treatments. Clerodendrum infortunatum Linn. (Lamiaceae) is a shrub traditionally used as a medicinal plant to treat inflammation, skin diseases, and bronchitis. This study aims to identify the main bioactive metabolites in C. infortunatum using LC-QTOF-MS/MS and investigate its potential in protecting against cognitive decline in rats with scopolamine-induced AD disease. Metabolite profiling was performed on the methanol extract of the plant's aerial parts using LC-QTOF-MS/MS. The inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme was measured in vitro. To evaluate the cognitive effects, the methanol extract was orally administered at three doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) to scopolamine-induced AD rats, and their cognitive functions were assessed using the novel object recognition test. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity, as well as the levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, glutathione, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and amyloid-β in the rat hippocampus, were measured using ELISA, followed by histopathological evaluation. A total of 79 metabolites, spanning various chemical classes, such as organic acids, phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids and phenylethanoids, flavonoids, coumarins, other phenolics, and fatty acids and their derivatives, were identified. The results showed that the extract promoted enhanced cognitive functions in the novel object recognition test. Scopolamine administration significantly altered the acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and biomarker levels in the rat's hippocampus. However, treatment with C. infortunatum at 200 and 400 mg/kg almost restored these neurotransmitter levels to normal, which was further confirmed by histopathological analysis. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of C. infortunatum in mitigating cognitive decline in AD, with its first metabolite profiling revealing a range of bioactive compounds. The extract improved cognitive function in scopolamine-induced AD rats, restored acetylcholinesterase activity, normalized neurotransmitter levels, and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings suggest that C. infortunatum is a promising candidate for the development of natural therapies targeting AD.",Scientific reports
39753643,Addressing inter individual variability in CSF levels of brain derived proteins across neurodegenerative diseases.,"Accurate diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases require reliable biomarkers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are promising candidates for reflecting brain pathology; however, their diagnostic utility may be compromised by natural variability between individuals, weakening their association with disease. Here, we measured the levels of 69 pre-selected proteins in cerebrospinal fluid using antibody-based suspension bead array technology in a multi-disease cohort of 499 individuals with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), corticobasal syndrome, primary supranuclear palsy, along with healthy controls. We identify significant inter-individual variability in overall CSF levels of brain-derived proteins, which could not be attributed to specific disease associations. Using linear modelling, we show that adjusting for median CSF levels of brain-derived proteins increases the diagnostic accuracy of proteins previously identified as altered in CSF in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We further demonstrate a simplified approach for the adjustment using pairs of correlated proteins with opposite alteration in the diseases. With this approach, the proteins adjust for each other and further increase the biomarker performance through additive effect. When comparing the diseases, two proteins-neurofilament medium and myelin basic protein-showed increased levels in ALS compared to other diseases, and neurogranin showed a specific increase in AD. Several other proteins showed similar trends across the studied diseases, indicating that these proteins likely reflect shared processes related to neurodegeneration. Overall, our findings suggest that accounting for inter-individual variability is crucial in future studies to improve the identification and performance of relevant biomarkers. Importantly, we highlight the need for multi-disease studies to identify disease-specific biomarkers.",Scientific reports
39680094,DTI-ALPS index as a predictor of cognitive decline over 1 year.,"PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and impaired daily functioning. The glymphatic system removes neurotoxic waste, including amyloid-beta (Aβ), an important factor in AD pathogenesis. This study used the Diffusion Tensor Imaging Analysis Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index, which reflects glymphatic function, to explore its relationship with cognitive decline in patients with probable AD. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 16 participants aged 60-79 years with probable AD who were evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Glymphatic function was assessed using the DTI-ALPS index; plasma Aβ 42/40 ratios were measured to account for amyloid pathology. The relationship between the DTI-ALPS index and baseline cognitive function was analyzed using multiple regression models adjusted for age, sex, and plasma Aβ 42/40 ratios. Associations between the DTI-ALPS index and cognitive decline over 1 year were assessed by a model using the percentage change in the MMSE z-score as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Higher DTI-ALPS index was significantly associated with better baseline cognitive function as assessed by MMSE (standardized beta = 1.17, p < 0.001) and lower clinical severity as assessed by CDR (standardized beta = - 1.00, p = 0.006). Over the 1-year follow-up, greater baseline DTI-ALPS index values were associated with less cognitive decline (standardized beta = - 0.85, p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that DTI-ALPS index is associated with cognitive performance and is a biomarker for predicting cognitive decline in AD. Future studies should consider larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to validate these findings.",Neuroradiology
39732510,Plasma phosphorylated tau and neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but their neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood. METHODS: NPSs and cognition were assessed annually in participants (DLB n = 222; Alzheimer's disease [AD] n = 125) from the European DLB (E-DLB) Consortium, and plasma phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) and p-tau231 concentrations were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Hallucinations, delusions, and depression were more common in DLB than in AD and, in a subgroup with longitudinal follow-up, persistent hallucinations and NPSs were associated with lower p-tau181 and p-tau231 in DLB. In adjusted linear mixed-effects models, hallucinations at baseline were associated with greater longitudinal cognitive impairment in DLB, with a significant interaction with p-tau231. DISCUSSION: Higher p-tau181 and p-tau231 levels were associated with a lower longitudinal risk of NPSs and hallucinations in early-stage DLB. However, the interaction between hallucinations and p-tau231 suggests that when AD co-pathology and hallucinations do co-exist in DLB that they may synergistically exacerbate cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) were more common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower plasma phosphorylated tau-231 (p-tau231) and p-tau181 levels were associated with persistent hallucinations in DLB. Lower plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181 levels were associated with an increased risk of persistent NPSs in early DLB. Hallucinations at baseline were associated with greater cognitive dysfunction in DLB, and there was an interaction with p-tau231.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39800463,Plasma amyloid-β precursor protein (669-711)/amyloid-β(1-42) ratio is associated with cognition in Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) markers are significant predictors of Aβ pathology. However, their prognostic value for cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. We compared plasma amyloid-β precursor protein (APP)(669-711) and Aβ(1-42) levels between cognitively unimpaired participants (CU) and those with MCI due to AD and AD dementia. The CU group was divided into CU+ or CU- groups according to presence of Aβ pathology. All patients with AD exhibited Aβ pathology. The plasma APP(669-711)/Aβ(1-42) ratio was significantly elevated in patients with CU+, MCI+, and AD+ compared with those with CU-. Furthermore, the plasma APP(669-711)/Aβ(1-42) ratio was significantly correlated with the MMSE score (rs = -0.544, p < 0.001). Analysis of the Aβ+ group revealed that the significant relationship between MMSE score and plasma APP(669-711)/Aβ(1-42) ratio remained unchanged (rs = -0.244, p = 0.027). Therefore, we conclude that the plasma APP(669-711)/Aβ(1-42) ratio is associated with cognition in patients with AD.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39842780,Plasma adiponectin and biomarker-confirmed Alzheimer's disease in a tertiary memory clinic.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with early metabolic dysfunction and adiponectin, which may play a pathophysiological role. Adiponectin is implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in inflammation modulation. The aim of this study was to study whether plasma adiponectin levels were different between patients with AD confirmed by biomarkers and neurological control subjects. We performed a monocentric, retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study in AD patients and neurological controls recruited from daily clinical practice in a tertiary memory clinic. Plasma adiponectin levels were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. We analyzed the relationship between adiponectin and AD using linear regression models including age, gender, and BMI. We also described the distribution of adiponectin concentrations, across age, and gender categories. Two hundred and six patients (142 AD patients and 64 neurological controls) were included, with mean age = 68.8 ± 10.0 years, and 56% were women. Higher adiponectin concentrations were observed in females and in older adults. Plasma adiponectin levels were significantly higher in AD patients (mean = 6.45 ± 3.42 μg/mL) than neurological controls (4.85 ± 3.54 μg/mL) (p < .001). This association was mediated by age, gender, and BMI, which were significantly and independently associated with plasma adiponectin levels (p < .01 for each), while adiponectin was no longer associated with AD in multivariate models. Patients with AD showed higher adiponectin levels, but this association was driven by older age, female gender, and lower BMI in the AD group. Further studies are needed to better characterize the hormonal signature of AD.",Journal of neuroendocrinology
39871333,Studying Alzheimer's disease through an integrative serum metabolomic and lipoproteomic approach.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. The great variability in disease evolution and the incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD make it difficult to predict when a patient will convert from prodromal stage to dementia. We hypothesize that metabolic alterations present at the level of the brain could be reflected at a systemic level in blood serum of patients, and that these alterations could be used as prognostic biomarkers. METHODS: This pilot study proposes a serum investigation via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in a consecutive series of AD patients including 57 patients affected by Alzheimer's disease at dementia stage (AD-dem) and 45 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (MCI-AD). As control group, we considered 31 subjects with mild cognitive impairment in whom AD and other neurodegenerative disorders were excluded (MCI). A panel of 26 metabolites and 112 lipoprotein-related parameters was quantified and the logistic LASSO regression algorithm was employed to identify the optimal combination of metabolites-lipoproteins and their ratios to discriminate the groups of interest. RESULTS: In the training set, our model classified AD-dem and MCI with an accuracy of 81.7%. These results were reproduced in the validation set (accuracy 75.0%). Evolution of MCI-AD patients was evaluated over time. Patients who displayed a decrease in MMSE < 1.5 point per year were considered at lower progression rate: we obtained a division in 18 MCI-AD at lower progression rate (MCI-AD LR) and 27 at higher progression rate (MCI-AD HR). The model calculated using 4 metabolic features identified MCI-AD LR and MCI-AD HR with an accuracy of 73.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of potential novel peripheral biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, as proposed in this study, opens a new prospect for an innovative and minimally invasive method to identify AD in its very early stages. We proposed a novel approach able to sub-stratify MCI-AD patients identifying those associated with a faster rate of clinical progression.",Journal of translational medicine
39820097,Screening of Aβ and phosphorylated tau status in the cerebrospinal fluid through machine learning analysis of portable electroencephalography data.,"Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) through pathological markers is typically costly and invasive. This study aims to find a noninvasive, cost-effective method using portable electroencephalography (EEG) to detect changes in AD-related biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 102 patients, both with and without AD-related biomarker changes (amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau), were recorded using a 2-minute resting-state portable EEG. A machine-learning algorithm then analyzed the EEG data to identify these biomarker changes. The results showed that the machine learning model could distinguish patients with AD-related biomarker changes, achieving 68.1% accuracy (AUROC 0.75) for amyloid beta and 71.2% accuracy (AUROC 0.77) for phosphorylated tau, with gamma activities being key features. When excluding cases with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, accuracy improved to 74.1% (AUROC 0.80) for amyloid beta and 73.1% (AUROC 0.80) for phosphorylated tau. This study suggests that portable EEG combined with machine learning is a promising noninvasive and cost-effective tool for early AD-related pathological marker screening, which could enhance neurophysiological understanding and diagnostic accessibility.",Scientific reports
39875084,Elevated plasma Tau-PT217 linked to decreased hippocampal functional connectivity in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is associated with a higher risk of developing dementia, though the underlying biological mechanisms have remained unclear. Recent studies suggest that blood phosphorylated tau proteins, particularly Tau-PT217, are sensitive biomarkers capable of detecting cognitive decline in its early stages, making it useful for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of cognitive impairment. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the plasma phosphorylated tau protein levels (Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181), hippocampus functional connectivity, and cognitive function in people with knee osteoarthritis compared to age and gender matched pain-free controls. RESULTS: We found that knee osteoarthritis was associated with increased plasma levels of Tau-PT217 (but not Tau-PT181), and that the Tau-PT217 is also correlated with reduced hippocampal functional connectivity with middle cingulate cortex. Our findings suggest a potential biological correlation between knee osteoarthritis and an elevated risk of dementia, contributing valuable insights that may guide the formulation of early intervention and preventative strategies to mitigate dementia in individuals with knee osteoarthritis.",Brain research
39708534,An objective and sensitive electrophysiological marker of word semantic categorization impairment in Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Combining electroencephalographic (EEG) recording and fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) to provide an implicit, objective and sensitive electrophysiological measure of semantic word categorization impairment in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). METHODS: Twenty-five AD patients and 25 matched elderly healthy controls were tested with a validated FPVS-EEG paradigm in which different written words of the same semantic category (cities) appear at a fixed frequency of 4 words per second (4 Hz) for 70 seconds. Words from a different semantic category (animal) appear every 4 stimuli (i.e., 1 Hz). RESULTS: Frequency domain EEG analysis showed a robust response objectively identified at specific 1 Hz harmonics over the left occipito-temporal cortex for healthy controls, indexing automatic semantic categorization. However, only a negligible response, less than 25 % of healthy controls', was found in AD patients, this response being inversely correlated with the amount of Tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. The significant group difference was maximal when including an additional left central region, with only 2.5 min of testing providing a significant group difference. CONCLUSION: A reduced semantic word categorisation EEG amplitude rapidly differentiates AD patients from healthy controls. SIGNIFICANCE: FPVS-EEG provides a valuable electrophysiological index of semantic categorization impairment in AD.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of
38751054,Moving Beyond Depression: Mood Symptoms Across the Spectrum Relate to Tau Pathology in Older Women at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease.,"We examined how symptoms across the mood spectrum relate to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in older women at high risk for AD. Participants included 25 women aged 65+ with mild cognitive deficits and elevated AD genetic risk. The Profile of Mood States Questionnaire measured mood symptoms and a total mood disturbance (TMD) score. Tau burden in the meta-temporal region of interest was measured using MK-6240 Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A subset (n = 12) also had p-Tau181, and Aß40/42 levels measured in plasma. Higher TMD scores related to higher tau PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Greater negative mood symptoms correlated with higher tau PET SUVR, while greater vigor correlated with lower SUVR. Similar results were seen with plasma p-Tau181 levels, but not with Aβ40/42 levels. In conclusion, positive and negative mood symptoms related to tau pathology in older women at high risk for AD, highlighting a role of mental well-being in AD risk.",International journal of aging & human development
39693925,Multifunctional porphyrin-substituted phenylalanine-phenylalanine nanoparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in Alzheimer's disease.,"β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides are believed as the diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their complexes with copper ions can catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to further promote neuronal death. Herein, we suggested that porphyrin-substituted phenylalanine-phenylalanine nanoparticles (TPP-FF NPs) could inhibit the aggregation of Aβ monomers, disassemble the fibrillar Aβ aggregates under light illumination, and depressing the Cu(2+)-induced generation of ROS. Meanwhile, the TPP-FF NPs could be used as the nanocarriers and quenchers of fluorescently-labeled probes for the detection of Aβ oligomer (AβO). Inhibition of Aβ assembly and dissolution of Aβ aggregates were monitored by Thioflavin T (ThT)-based fluorescent assay and characterized by atomic force microscopy. The Aβ/Cu(2+)-induced generation of ROS was limited by TPP-FF NPs. The fluorescein-labeled probe aptamers attached on the surface of TPP-FF NPs emitted low fluorescence. The interaction between AβO and aptamers induced the release of the probes from the surface of TPP-FF NPs, driving the fluorophore far away from the quenchers and turning on the fluorescence. The signal-on strategy can be used for the detection of AβO with a low detection limit. This work should be evaluable for the development of multifunctional candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Bioorganic chemistry
39571936,Biomarker and neuropsychological correlates of the N400 event-related potential in Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to characterize the relationship of the N400 (N4) effect event-related potential to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and broader cognition in older adults on the late-life cognitive continuum. METHOD: Participants who were cognitively intact (n = 43), or had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 19), or mild AD (n = 12), completed a word-pair judgement task during concurrent EEG recording to elicit the N400. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and biomarker data (PET-imaged beta-amyloid (aβ) deposition, apolipoprotein-E ε4 (APOE4) allele status, hippocampal volumes) were collected as part of a larger study. RESULTS: The AD group had slower response times and poorer accuracy on the word-pair judgement task than the intact group. The N4 effect was smaller and occurred later in AD relative to intact participants. MCI participants' values were intermediate. N4 effect amplitudes were not associated with RBANS scores but were positively associated with aβ deposition. Conversely, poorer performance across most RBANS Indexes and the Total score was associated with longer N4 latencies. There was also a negative association between hippocampal volumes and the N4 latency and a positive association between aβ deposition and latency. Finally, the latency of the N4 independently predicted variance in RBANS Total scores, above and beyond aβ deposition, hippocampal volumes, and APOE4 allele status. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the relevance of the N4 effect in individuals along the late-life cognitive continuum, and motivate future studies into its potential as a longitudinal predictor in AD.",International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International
39546981,IGUANe: A 3D generalizable CycleGAN for multicenter harmonization of brain MR images.,"In MRI studies, the aggregation of imaging data from multiple acquisition sites enhances sample size but may introduce site-related variabilities that hinder consistency in subsequent analyses. Deep learning methods for image translation have emerged as a solution for harmonizing MR images across sites. In this study, we introduce IGUANe (Image Generation with Unified Adversarial Networks), an original 3D model that leverages the strengths of domain translation and straightforward application of style transfer methods for multicenter brain MR image harmonization. IGUANe extends CycleGAN by integrating an arbitrary number of domains for training through a many-to-one architecture. The framework based on domain pairs enables the implementation of sampling strategies that prevent confusion between site-related and biological variabilities. During inference, the model can be applied to any image, even from an unknown acquisition site, making it a universal generator for harmonization. Trained on a dataset comprising T1-weighted images from 11 different scanners, IGUANe was evaluated on data from unseen sites. The assessments included the transformation of MR images with traveling subjects, the preservation of pairwise distances between MR images within domains, the evolution of volumetric patterns related to age and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the performance in age regression and patient classification tasks. Comparisons with other harmonization and normalization methods suggest that IGUANe better preserves individual information in MR images and is more suitable for maintaining and reinforcing variabilities related to age and AD. Future studies may further assess IGUANe in other multicenter contexts, either using the same model or retraining it for applications to different image modalities. Codes and the trained IGUANe model are available at https://github.com/RocaVincent/iguane_harmonization.git.",Medical image analysis
39777972,Pathological angiogenesis was associated with cerebrovascular lesion and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the specific factors driving abnormal angiogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its role in cerebrovascular lesions and neurodegeneration. METHODS: We assessed cerebrovascular pathologies, amyloid-beta (Aβ), and tau pathologies in post mortem human brains and detected 12 angiogenic factors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (CANDI) cohort. RESULTS: We observed severe blood-brain barrier damage and elevated levels of the vascular marker CD31 in human AD brains, which had a stronger correlation with tau pathology than Aβ pathology. Consistently, only CSF pTau181 showed positive associations with CSF angiogenesis factors (soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [sVEGFR2], VEGF-C, VEGF-D, placental growth factor [PLGF], Angiopoietin2, and Serpin E1), but not CSF Aβ42/40. Additionally, higher levels of CSF sVEGFR1, soluble Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor 2 [sTIE2], PLGF, and interleukin 8 [IL8], as well as lower levels of CSF urokinase-type plasminogen activator [uPA], were associated with worsen cerebrovascular pathologies and neurodegeneration. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that tau pathology may play a critical role in pathological angiogenesis, contributing to cerebrovascular lesions and neurodegeneration in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: BBB damage and elevated vascular marker CD31 in human AD brains had a stronger correlation with tau pathology than Aβ pathology. CSF pTau181 mediated the effect of CSF Aβ42/40 on CSF sVEGFR1 and sTIE2. Only CSF pTau181 showed positive associations with sVEGFR2, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, PLGF, Angiopoietin2, and Serpin E1. Higher sVEGFR1, sTIE2, PLGF, and IL8, and lower uPA in CSF, were associated with cerebrovascular pathologies and neurodegeneration.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
40179065,Depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: A human post-mortem study.,"Depression is associated with persistent low mood. In mid to late life, it has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with evidence that depression might be an early manifestation of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms by which depression enhances AD development remain unknown, there are several features commonly seen in both diseases such as the presence of neuroinflammation. In this study, we aimed to identify whether neuroinflammation is increased in depression as observed in the early stages of AD by examining post-mortem human brain tissue. Post-mortem human brain tissue from 54 cases with depression and 37 controls without depression were retrieved from the Douglas Bell Canada Brain Bank. Sixteen early-stage AD cases defined as a Braak stage III-IV and 15 controls were sourced from the South West Dementia Brain Bank. Frozen tissue from the dorsal prefrontal cortex was obtained for all cases in order to measure inflammatory proteins (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α) and endothelial markers (ICAM-1, VCAM) using ELISA and MesoScale Multiplex Assays. In the depression group, increase of IL-6 and IL-10, and decrease of IL-1β were observed compared to controls, with no changes detected for the other cytokines and the endothelial markers. In early-stage AD cases, only increased ICAM-1 expression was found compared to controls, indicating endothelial activation as an early feature of AD. None of the cytokines measured showed alteration of their expression in early-stage AD cases. Depression, but not AD, was associated with evidence of neuroinflammation. Depression may increase AD risk through different mechanism(s) than inflammation.",PloS one
39074003,Harmonic Wavelet Neural Network for Discovering Neuropathological Propagation Patterns in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Emerging researchindicates that the degenerative biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a non-random distribution within the cerebral cortex, instead following the structural brain network. The alterations in brain networks occur much earlier than the onset of clinical symptoms, thereby affecting the progression of brain disease. In this context, the utilization of computational methods to ascertain the propagation patterns of neuropathological events would contribute to the comprehension of the pathophysiological mechanism involved in the evolution of AD. Despite the encouraging findings achieved by existing graph-based deep learning approaches in analyzing irregular graph data, their applications in identifying the spreading pathway of neuropathology are limited due to two disadvantages. They include (1) lack of a common brain network as an unbiased reference basis for group comparison, and (2) lack of an appropriate mechanism for the identification of propagation patterns. To this end, we propose a proof-of-concept harmonic wavelet neural network (HWNN) to predict the early stage of AD and localize disease-related significant wavelets, which can be used to characterize the spreading pathways of neuropathological events across the brain network. The extensive experiments constructed on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance in classification accuracy and statistical power of identifying propagation patterns, compared with other representative approaches.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics
39800469,Point of view: Challenges in implementation of new immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease.,"The advancement of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with the approval of three amyloid-targeting therapies in the US and several other countries, represents a significant development in the treatment landscape, offering new hope for addressing this once untreatable chronic progressive disease. However, significant challenges persist that could impede the successful integration of this class of drugs into clinical practice. These challenges include determining patient eligibility, appropriate use of diagnostic tools and genetic testing in patient care pathways, effective detection and monitoring of side effects, and improving the healthcare system's readiness by engaging both primary care and dementia specialists. Additionally, there are logistical concerns related to infrastructure, as well as cost-effectiveness and reimbursement issues. This article brings together insights from a diverse group of international researchers and dementia experts and outlines the potential challenges and opportunities, urging all stakeholders to prepare for the introduction of DMTs. We emphasize the need to develop appropriate use criteria, including patient characteristics, specifically for the European healthcare system, to ensure that treatments are administered to the most suitable patients. It is crucial to improve the skills and knowledge of physicians to accurately interpret biomarker results, share decision-making with patients, recognize treatment-related side effects, and monitor long-term treatment. We advocate for investment in patient registries and unbiased follow-up studies to better understand treatment effectiveness, evaluate treatment-related side effects, and optimize long-term treatment. Utilizing amyloid-targeting therapies as a starting point for combination therapies should also be a priority.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39976261,Implementing a tridimensional diagnostic framework for personalized medicine in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose a significant challenge in modern medicine due to their clinical heterogeneity, multifactorial etiologies, and frequent co-pathologies. Traditional diagnostic systems, based on clinical symptoms and post mortem findings, are limited in capturing the complex interactions among genetic, molecular, and neuroanatomical factors. This manuscript introduces a novel tridimensional diagnostic framework that integrates these factors across three key axes: etiology (genetic and environmental influences), molecular markers (primary and secondary biomarkers), and neuroanatomoclinical correlations. Through case studies, we demonstrate the framework's ability to synthesize incomplete datasets, stratify patients, and guide precision medicine. By incorporating omics technologies, neuroimaging, and AI-driven probabilistic modeling, the framework enhances diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. This approach may contribute to overcoming the limitations of traditional nosologies, offering a scalable and adaptable tool for both clinical practice and research and advancing the field of precision medicine in NDD management. HIGHLIGHTS: Tridimensional diagnostic system: We propose a new framework that incorporates three axes - etiology, molecular markers, and neuroanatomical-clinical correlations - to enhance diagnostic accuracy for NDDs. Personalized medicine: The tridimensional system enables the integration of genetic, molecular, and clinical data, allowing for highly personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patients. Proteinopathies as key biomarkers: This diagnostic system emphasizes the use of primary proteinopathies (amyloid, tau, synuclein) and secondary biomarkers (eg, NfL, GFAP) to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Addressing clinical heterogeneity: The framework accommodates the complexity and heterogeneity of NDDs, offering an adaptable diagnostic approach for classical conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS. Case studies and real-world application: Practical case studies illustrate how this system can be implemented in clinical practice, enabling the combination of DMTs with symptomatic treatments.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39862517,Target-induced proximity ligation triggers polymerase chain reaction for subset tracing of small extracellular vesicles.,"The considerable abundance and remarkable stability of sEVs provide substantial benefits for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, precise tracking subtypes of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) is crucial for screening novel diagnostic biomarkers and developing therapeutic technologies. We propose a three-target recognition-mediated proximity ligation assay for the precise identification of sEV subtypes utilizing three specifically designed probes: one for the exosomal surface protein CD63 recognition, one for fixing the biolipid layer, and the third for the identification of distinctive protein associated with a specific subtype of sEVs (L1CAM positive sEVs). The developed sEVs subtype tracing approach integrates proximity ligation of the three probes to specifically bind to surface biomarkers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for signal amplification, enabling ""AND"" logic analysis of three essential components on sEVs. This method can be utilized for both sEVs quantification and subtype tracing. The proposed approach demonstrated a low limit of detection for neuronal sEVs at 2.5 particles/μL, according to this design. In addition, we utilized this technique to measure plasma sEV levels in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and examined its early diagnostic effectiveness. The approach can assess the concentration ratios of neuronal sEVs and cancer-derived sEVs, highlighting its potential for clinical applications. In addition, the approach enables precise tracing and identification of sEVs subtypes, hence facilitating extensive applications in biological science, biomedical engineering, and personalized medicine.",Talanta
39760808,From Genes to Metabolites: HSP90B1's Role in Alzheimer's Disease and Potential for Therapeutic Intervention.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder, predominantly affecting individuals in the presenile and elderly populations, with an etiology that remains elusive. This investigation aimed to elucidate the alterations in anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in the AD brain, thereby expanding the repertoire of biomarkers for the disease. Using publically available gene expression data for the hippocampus from both healthy and AD subjects, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Subsequent intersection with a comprehensive list of 575 ARGs yielded a subset for enrichment analysis. Machine learning algorithms were employed to identify potential biomarker, which was validated in an AD animal model. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis was conducted on the biomarker and its interacting genes and microRNAs were predicted through online databases. To assess its biological functions, the expression of the marker was suppressed in an in vitro model to examine cell viability and inflammation-related indicators. Furthermore, following treatment with the inhibitor, the dysregulated metabolites in the hippocampus of the model mice were evaluated. Forty-seven ARGs were ultimately identified, with HSP90B1 emerging as a central marker. HSP90B1 was found to be significantly up-regulated in AD hippocampal samples and its inhibition conferred increased cell viability and reduced levels of inflammatory factors in amyloid β-protein (Aβ)-treated cells. A total of 24 differentially expressed metabolites were confidently identified between model mice and those with low HSP90B1 expression, with bioinformatics analysis shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of HSP90B1's involvement in AD. Collectively, these findings may inform novel insights into the pathogenesis, mechanisms, or therapeutic strategies for AD.",Neuromolecular medicine

They must also define clinically meaningful outcomes for patients and set endpoints that measure these outcomes accurately. With the accelerated United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first anti-amyloid, disease-modifying treatment for AD, a monoclonal antibody called aducanumab, the landscape of clinical trial design is evolving. Enrolment in clinical trials may be impacted by the availability of this and other treatments, and trial design must take into consideration that patients may desire a disease-modifying treatment rather than potentially being randomized to the placebo arm. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Fall 2021 meeting discussed the consideration of well-defined AD staging criteria in protocol design and how they influence more standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria for trials, as well as what constitutes meaningful differentiation between the stages. Discussion explored the current state of knowledge regarding biomarkers and how they can inform AD staging criteria, as many trials are now designed based on specific biomarker features, further underscoring the importance of coordinating AD staging criteria and biomarkers. The relationship between cognition and biomarkers has been studied and this must continue as trials move forward. Researchers, patients, clinicians, regulatory scientists, and payers discussed the state of the field as well as the future of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from academia and industry as well as patients, care partners, clinicians, regulators, and payers to discuss the topic of operationalizing selection criteria for clinical trials and the role of biomarkers.Well-defined Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging criteria are an important consideration in study protocol design.Staging criteria and biomarkers must be coordinated to yield high-quality clinical trial results that have meaning for patients with AD by selecting a population most likely to benefit from a specific treatment.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39670533,Post mortem validation and mechanistic study of UCB-J in progressive supranuclear palsy patients' brains.,"INTRODUCTION: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a devastating 4R tauopathy affecting motor functions and is often misdiagnosed/underdiagnosed due to a lack of specific biomarkers. Synaptic loss is an eminent feature of tauopathies including PSP. Novel synaptic positron emission tomography tracer UCB-J holds great potential for early diagnosis; however, there is a substantial knowledge gap in terms of the mechanism and the extent and nature of synaptic loss in PSP. METHODS: Here, we report an in-depth post mortem validation and mechanistic study of UCB-J in PSP and control brains using radioligand/autoradiography binding studies, alongside biochemical correlation analyses of synaptic markers. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: (3)H-UCB-J targeted synaptic vesicle protein 2A protein with high specificity and demonstrated a distinct interrelation with synaptic markers in PSP patients' brain regions. The loss of UCB-J binding in the early and severely affected globus pallidus of PSP patients' brains revealed deficits of glutamate/GABAergic synaptic terminals. Cortical and subcortical 4R tau load differentially impacted synaptic marker profiles across PSP patients, warranting further investigation. HIGHLIGHTS: UCB-J targeted synaptic vesicle protein 2A with high specificity in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) brains and demonstrated a conserved single nM binding site across different brain regions. UCB-J depicted prominent synaptic loss at the synaptosome levels and revealed deficits of glutamate/GABAergic synaptic terminals in the early affected globus pallidus of PSP brains as compared to the control. Cortical and subcortical 4R tau load distinctly influenced synaptic markers profile across PSP patients and highlighted that presynaptic ""ubiquitous"" markers individually might not be able to represent the complete state of synaptic deficits/loss in PSP brains.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39936947,"Cortical Diffusivity, a Biomarker for Early Neuronal Damage, Is Associated with Amyloid-β Deposition: A Pilot Study.","Pathological alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin several years prior to symptom onset. Cortical mean diffusivity (cMD) may be used as a measure of early grey matter damage in AD as it reflects the breakdown of microstructural barriers preceding volumetric changes and affecting cognitive function. We investigated cMD changes early in the disease trajectory and evaluated the influence of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau deposition. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed multimodal PET, DTI, and MRI data of 87 participants, and stratified them into Aβ-negative and -positive, cognitively normal, mildly cognitively impaired, and AD patients. cMD was significantly increased in Aβ-positive MCI and AD compared with CN in the frontal, parietal, temporal cortex, hippocampus, and medial temporal lobe. cMD was significantly correlated with cortical thickness only in patients without Aβ deposition but not in Aβ-positive patients. Our results suggest that cMD is an early marker of neuronal damage since it is observed simultaneously with Aβ deposition and is correlated with cortical thickness only in subjects without Aβ deposition. cMD changes may be driven by Aβ but not tau, suggesting that direct Aβ toxicity or associated inflammation causes damage to neurons. cMD may provide information about early microstructural changes before macrostructural changes.",Cells
39740107,Facing the new diagnostic and treatment options of Alzheimer's disease: The necessity of informed consent.,"With advances in biomarker-based detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and new treatment options with disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), we are heading toward a new conceptualization of diagnostics and therapy in the early stages of AD. Yet consensus guidelines on best clinical practices in predictive AD diagnostics are still developing. Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding counseling and disclosure practices in early symptomatic disease stages, its implications for dementia risk estimation, and DMTs with associated risks and benefits. The crucial feature is the capacity of patients with (mild) cognitive impairment, eligible for DMTs, to consent. This perspective aims to (1) discuss the current challenges in assessing capacity to consent and (2) highlight the importance of a supported (informed) decision-making process. Measures to facilitate informed decision-making of patients constitute an ethical approach to enhancing the quality of care in this evolving therapeutic landscape. HIGHLIGHTS: This perspective: Explores biomarker-based early symptomatic AD detection and the implications for patient care. Emphasizes supported decision-making in DMTs for MCI and dementia patients. Discusses the need for standardized tools to assess the capacity to consent.

39940829,Network Diffusion-Constrained Variational Generative Models for Investigating the Molecular Dynamics of Brain Connectomes Under Neurodegeneration.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative condition with significant societal impact. Understanding the temporal dynamics of its pathology is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. Empirical and anatomical evidence indicates that network decoupling occurs as a result of gray matter atrophy. However, the scarcity of longitudinal clinical data presents challenges for computer-based simulations. To address this, a first-principles-based, physics-constrained Bayesian framework is proposed to model time-dependent connectome dynamics during neurodegeneration. This temporal diffusion network framework segments pathological progression into discrete time windows and optimizes connectome distributions for biomarker Bayesian regression, conceptualized as a learning problem. The framework employs a variational autoencoder-like architecture with computational enhancements to stabilize and improve training efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed temporal meta-models outperform traditional static diffusion models. The models were evaluated using both synthetic and real-world MRI and PET clinical datasets that measure amyloid beta, tau, and glucose metabolism. The framework successfully distinguishes normative aging from AD pathology. Findings provide novel support for the ""decoupling"" hypothesis and reveal eigenvalue-based evidence of pathological destabilization in AD. Future optimization of the model, integrated with real-world clinical data, is expected to improve applications in personalized medicine for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences
40293889,Enhancing Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis Through Confidence-Driven Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network.,"Dynamic brain networks are more effective than static networks in characterizing the evolving patterns of brain functional connectivity, making them a more promising tool for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing classification methods for dynamic brain networks often rely on sliding windows to extract multi-window features, leading to suboptimal performance due to the spatio-temporal coupling on these windows and limited ability to effectively integrate complex topological features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Confidence-Driven Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network (CD-DSTCN). First, our proposed method employs a spatio-temporal convolutional network integrated with a temporal attention mechanism to extract spatio-temporal features within each window. By propagating information across temporal windows during spatial convolution, the method effectively captures and integrates complex temporal and spatial dependencies. Second, each window generates an output probability, which quantifies prediction confidence based on the true class probability (TCP). This confidence score serves as a weight to assess the relative importance of different time windows. Finally, the confidence-weighted fused features are passed through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for final classification. Extensive experiments on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and can provide valuable biomarkers for brain disease diagnosis.

39670391,Astrocyte Reactivity Polygenic Risk Score May Predict Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a polygenic disorder with a prolonged prodromal phase, complicating early diagnosis. Recent research indicates that increased astrocyte reactivity is associated with a higher risk of pathogenic tau accumulation, particularly in amyloid-positive individuals. However, few clinical tools are available to predict which individuals are likely to exhibit elevated astrocyte activation and, consequently, be susceptible to hyperphosphorylated tau-induced neurodegeneration. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of multiple genetic loci to provide a single, continuous metric representing an individual's genetic risk for a specific phenotype. We hypothesized that an astrocyte activation PRS could aid in the early detection of faster clinical decline. Therefore, we constructed an astrocyte activation PRS and assessed its predictive value for cognitive decline and AD biomarkers (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] levels of Aβ1-42, total tau, and p-tau181) in a cohort of 791 elderly individuals. The astrocyte activation PRS showed significant main effects on cross-sectional memory (β = -0.07, p = 0.03) and longitudinal executive function (β = -0.01, p = 0.03). Additionally, the PRS interacted with amyloid positivity (p.intx = 0.02), whereby indicating that amyloid burden modifies the association between the PRS and annual rate of language decline. Furthermore, the PRS was negatively associated with CSF Aβ1-42 levels (β = -3.4, p = 0.07) and interacted with amyloid status, such that amyloid burden modifies the association between the PRS and CSF phosphorylated tau levels (p.intx = 0.08). These findings suggest that an astrocyte activation PRS could be a valuable tool for early disease risk prediction, potentially enabling intervention during the interval between pathogenic amyloid and tau accumulation.",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

39812690,Dysregulation of the molecular clock by blood-borne factors in Alzheimer's disease patients.,"BACKGROUND: Circadian disruptions are increasingly recognized in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and may influence disease onset and progression. This study examines how AD pathology affects blood-borne factors that regulate circadian rhythms. METHODS: Eighty-five participants from the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline were enrolled: 35 amyloid-beta negative normal controls (Aβ- NCs), 23 amyloid-beta positive normal controls (Aβ+ NCs), 15 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 12 with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Patients with aMCI and ADD were grouped as cognitively impaired (CI). Cellular circadian period length was assessed using a serum-based assay. Expression levels of clock genes in serum-treated cells and in leukocytes of participants were measured via real-time PCR. Plasma biomarkers were quantified using a single-molecule array immunoassay. Pineal parenchymal and hippocampal volumes were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The cellular circadian period length was significantly extended by serum from CI patients than by that from Aβ- NCs (p < 0.01). Treatment of cells with serum from the CI patients resulted in suppressed expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Nr1d1. Strong relationships between the expression levels of clock genes observed in leukocytes of the Aβ- NC group did not appear in those of the Aβ+ NC or CI groups. The significant correlation of cellular circadian period length and the pineal volume was only observed in the Aβ- NC group, but not in the Aβ+ NC or CI groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the presence of significant changes in blood-borne factors that could affect the circadian rhythms in AD, starting even at preclinical stages. These alterations could precede cognitive decline and contribute to AD pathogenesis.

39692594,A Machine Learning Model to Harmonize Volumetric Brain MRI Data for Quantitative Neuroradiologic Assessment of Alzheimer Disease.,"Purpose To extend a previously developed machine learning algorithm for harmonizing brain volumetric data of individuals undergoing neuroradiologic assessment of Alzheimer disease not encountered during model training. Materials and Methods Neuroharmony is a recently developed method that uses image quality metrics as predictors to remove scanner-related effects in brain-volumetric data using random forest regression. To account for the interactions between Alzheimer disease pathology and image quality metrics during harmonization, the authors developed a multiclass extension of Neuroharmony for individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Cross-validation experiments were performed to benchmark performance against other available strategies using data from 20 864 participants with and without cognitive impairment, spanning 11 prospective and retrospective cohorts and 43 scanners. Evaluation metrics assessed the ability to remove scanner-related variations in brain volumes (marker concordance between scanner pairs) while retaining the ability to delineate different diagnostic groups (preserving disease-related signal). Results For each strategy, marker concordances between scanners were significantly better (P < .001) compared with preharmonized data. The proposed multiclass model achieved significantly higher concordance (mean, 0.75 ± 0.09 [SD]) than the Neuroharmony model trained on individuals without cognitive impairment (mean, 0.70 ± 0.11) and preserved disease-related signal (∆AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = -0.006 ± 0.027) better than the Neuroharmony model trained on individuals with and without cognitive impairment that did not use the proposed extension (∆AUC = -0.091 ± 0.036). The marker concordance was better in scanners seen during training (concordance > 0.97) than unseen (concordance < 0.79), independent of cognitive status. Conclusion In a large-scale multicenter dataset, the proposed multiclass Neuroharmony model outperformed other available strategies for harmonizing brain volumetric data from unseen scanners in a clinical setting.

We describe the clinical phenotype and neuropathological findings in a family from County Limerick in Ireland presenting with Alzheimer's disease-like cognitive decline and motor symptoms caused by a novel missense mutation of PRNP. This mutation occurs in the PRNP central lysine cluster (CLC; codon 101-110), resulting in substitution of threonine with isoleucine at codon 107 (T107I). This case series highlights that IPD can be hard to distinguish from overlapping clinical syndromes seen in other neurodegenerative diseases.

METHODS: Using 2D gray level co-occurrence matrix (2D-GLCM) texture features, volume, standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), and obesity from different neuroimaging modalities, the study applies various classifiers, demonstrating a feature importance analysis in each region of interest. The research employs four classifiers, namely linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression (LR), and logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent (LRSGD) classifiers, to determine feature importance, leading to subsequent validation using a probabilistic neural network classifier. RESULTS: The research highlights the critical role of brain texture features, particularly in memory regions, for AD detection. Significant sex-specific differences are observed, with males showing significance in texture features in memory regions, volume in vision regions, and SUVR in speech regions, while females exhibit significance in texture features in memory and speech regions, and SUVR in vision regions. Additionally, the study analyzes how obesity affects features used in AD prediction models, clarifying its effects on speech and vision regions, particularly brain volume. CONCLUSION: The findings contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of feature fusion, sex-specific differences, and the impact of obesity on AD-related biomarkers, paving the way for future research in early AD detection strategies and cognitive impairment classification.",Digital biomarkers
39623969,"Real-life reliability of plasma pTau181, Aβ(42)/Aβ(40), and pTau181/Aβ(42) measured by Lumipulse G600II in predicting cerebrospinal fluid amyloid status.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia, with diagnosis traditionally reliant on clinical criteria. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers like pTau181 and Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio significantly improve diagnostic accuracy but are invasive. Plasma biomarkers measured by automated assays offer a non-invasive alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of plasma pTau181, Aβ(42)/Aβ(40), and pTau181/Aβ(42) ratios in predicting CSF amyloid status in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: Data from consecutive patients whose plasma and CSF samples sent to our laboratory between March and October 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Plasma and CSF pTau181, Aβ(42), and Aβ(40) levels were measured using the Lumipulse G600II platform. CSF amyloid status was classified as amyloid-positive (A+) or amyloid-negative (A-) based on the Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio. Statistical analyses included Spearman correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate biomarker performance. RESULTS: Among 165 individuals (83 females), 29.1% were classified as A+. Significant correlations were found between plasma and CSF biomarkers, with the highest for the pTau181/Aβ(42) ratio (ρ=0.620, p < 0.0001). ROC analysis showed the pTau181/Aβ(42) ratio had the highest diagnostic performance (AUC 0.818), followed by pTau181 (AUC 0.794) and Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) (AUC 0.775). Combining plasma biomarkers in age-adjusted models improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC up to 0.846). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarkers measured by the Lumipulse G600II platform show strong potential in predicting CSF amyloid status and possibly reduces the need for lumbar punctures. These findings support the potential use of plasma assays in the early diagnosis of AD. Anyway, further validations in larger multicenter cohorts are mandatory.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39418829,Knowledge-driven multi-graph convolutional network for brain network analysis and potential biomarker discovery.,"In brain network analysis, individual-level data can provide biological features of individuals, while population-level data can provide demographic information of populations. However, existing methods mostly utilize either individual- or population-level features separately, inevitably neglecting the multi-level characteristics of brain disorders. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end multi-graph neural network model called KMGCN. This model simultaneously leverages individual- and population-level features for brain network analysis. At the individual level, we construct multi-graph using both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches. Knowledge-driven refers to constructing a knowledge graph based on prior knowledge, while data-driven involves learning a data graph from the data itself. At the population level, we construct multi-graph using both imaging and phenotypic data. Additionally, we devise a pooling method tailored for brain networks, capable of selecting brain regions that impact brain disorders. We evaluate the performance of our model on two large datasets, ADNI and ABIDE, and experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 86.87% classification accuracy for ADNI and 86.40% for ABIDE, accompanied by around 10% improvements in all evaluation metrics compared to the state-of-the-art models. Additionally, the biomarkers identified by our model align well with recent neuroscience research, indicating the effectiveness of our model in brain network analysis and potential biomarker discovery.

39260276,Real-time detection of Tau-381 protein using liquid crystal-based sensors for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Tau is a protein found in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in stabilizing microtubules in axons. Given the link between Tau levels in the body and Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a demand for straightforward and precise strategies to detect Tau in body fluids. In this study, we report liquid crystal (LC)-based sensors for the real-time detection of Tau protein, a well-known AD biomarker. The sensor uses a detection method based on the orientation change of the LC because of the competitive biomolecular interaction between Tau and Tau aptamers with the cationic polymer poly-L-lysine (PLL). Tau and its aptamers form stable complexes through electrostatic interactions. Owing to the consumption of the aptamer, the positively charged PLL fails to interact with the aptamer but binds to the negatively charged 1.2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) sodium salt (DOPG). The PLL and DOPG complex alters the orientation of the LC to ensure a planar anchoring of the 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB)/aqueous interface; this anchoring intensifies with increasing Tau concentration, thus enabling the observation of a bright optical image. Our LC-based sensor demonstrated a low detection limit of 2.77 pg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 10.86 pg/mL and 19.31 pg/mL in human serum and plasma, respectively. Moreover, it is anticipated to be suitable for point-of-care diagnosis of AD because it does not require specialized analytical equipment and only requires microliters of sample.","Colloids and surfaces.

39868793,Linking higher amyloid beta 1-38 (Aβ(1-38)) levels to reduced Alzheimer's disease progression risk.,"INTRODUCTION: The beneficial effects of amyloid beta 1-38, or Aβ(1-38), on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in humans in vivo remain controversial. We investigated AD patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ(1-38) and AD progression. METHODS: Cognitive function and diagnostic change were assessed annually for 3 years in 177 Aβ-positive participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) longitudinal cognitive impairment and dementia study (DELCODE) cohort using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. Mixed linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted. CSF was collected at baseline. RESULTS: Higher Aβ(1-38) levels were associated with slower PACC (p = 0.001) and slower CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (p = 0.002) but not MMSE decline. Including Aβ(1-40) beyond Aβ(1-38) in the model confirmed an association of Aβ(1-38) with slower PACC decline (p = 0.005), but not with CDR-SB or MMSE decline. In addition, higher Aβ(1-38) baseline levels were associated with a reduced dementia conversion risk. DISCUSSION: Further research is needed to understand the role of Aβ(1-38) in AD and its potential for future therapeutic strategies. HIGHLIGHTS: This study not only replicates but also extends the existing findings on the role of Aβ(1-38) (amyloid beta 1-38) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans in vivo. Higher baseline Aβ(1-38) levels were associated with a decreased risk of conversion to AD dementia in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Different linear-mixed regression models suggest an association between higher Aβ(1-38) baseline levels and slower Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) decline. Including Aβ(1-40) beyond Aβ(1-38) in the model confirmed a link between Aβ(1-38) and PACC decline, but showed no association of Aβ(1-38) on CDR-SB and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) decline. The impact of short Aβ isoforms in AD progression might have been under-investigated These findings underscore the urgent need for additional research on the role of these shorter Aβ peptides in AD, as they may hold key insights for future therapeutic strategies.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
40030191,Image-and-Label Conditioning Latent Diffusion Model: Synthesizing A$\beta$-PET From MRI for Detecting Amyloid Status.,"Deposition of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$), which is generally observed by A$\beta$-PET, is an important biomarker to evaluate subjects with early-onset dementia. However, acquisition of A$\beta$-PET usually suffers from high expense and radiation hazards, making A$\beta$-PET not commonly used as MRI. As A$\beta$-PET scans are only used to determine whether A$\beta$ deposition is positive or not, it is highly valuable to capture the underlying relationship between A$\beta$ deposition and other neuroimages (i.e., MRI) and detect amyloid status based on other neuroimages to reduce necessity of acquiring A$\beta$-PET. To this end, we propose an image-and-label conditioning latent diffusion model (IL-CLDM) to synthesize A$\beta$-PET scans from MRI scans by enhancing critical shared information to finally achieve MRI-based A$\beta$ classification. Specifically, two conditioning modules are introduced to enable IL-CLDM to implicitly learn joint image synthesis and diagnosis: 1) an image conditioning module, to extract meaningful features from source MRI scans to provide structural information, and 2) a label conditioning module, to guide the alignment of generated scans to the diagnosed label. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 510 subjects demonstrate that our proposed IL-CLDM achieves image quality superior to five widely used models, and our synthesized A$\beta$-PET scans (by IL-CLDM) can significantly help classification of A$\beta$ as positive or negative.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics
39762903,Effects of Alzheimer's disease plasma marker levels on multilayer centrality in healthy individuals.,"BACKGROUND: Changes in amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau brain levels are known to affect brain network organization but very little is known about how plasma markers can relate to these measures. We aimed to address the relationship between centrality network changes and two plasma pathology markers: phosphorylated tau at threonine 231 (p-tau231), a proxy for early Aβ change, and neurofilament light chain (Nfl), a marker of axonal degeneration. METHODS: One hundred and four cognitively unimpaired individuals were divided into a high pathology load (33 individuals; HP) group and a low pathology (71 individuals; LP) one. All participants underwent a magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording, a neuropsychological evaluation and plasma sampling. With the MEG recordings, a compound centrality score for each brain source was calculated that considered both intra- and inter-band links. For each group, the relationship between this centrality score and the two plasma markers was studied by means of correlation analyses. Furthermore, the relationship between the centrality score and the plasma markers among the HP and LP groups was compared. Lastly, we investigated whether hubs were more intensely affected by these changes. RESULTS: Increasing concentrations of p-tau231, which is a proxy of Aβ pathology, were associated with greater theta centrality score of posterior areas that increased their connectedness in the theta range with the remaining areas, regardless of the latter's frequency range. The opposite relationship was found for left areas that decreased their centrality score in the gamma frequency range. These results only emerged for HP individuals, who showed a significantly different relationship between centrality and p-tau231 compared to LP individuals. Hubs' centrality score in the theta band was significantly more affected by p-tau231 levels compared to less central regions. CONCLUSIONS: Early brain network reorganizations in cognitively unimpaired individuals are associated with elevated plasma p-tau231, a proxy for very early Aβ changes, only among individuals who show signs of a higher pathology load. Posterior centrality score increases in the theta band are congruent with previous literature and theoretical models, while gamma centrality score losses could be associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Hubs were more intensely affected by p-tau231, and changed to a higher degree, thus corroborating hubs' vulnerability.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
39800455,Motor abilities and cognitive performance in Latinos with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Declining motor abilities might be a noninvasive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studying motor ability and AD progression in younger Latinos with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) can provide insights into the interplay between motor ability and cognition in individuals with minimal confounding from age-normative changes and comorbid medical conditions. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to (1) examine motor abilities as a function of years to dementia diagnosis and (2) examine associations between motor ability and cognitive performance. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: The study took place at the University of Southern California. PARTICIPANTS: 39 predominately Latino individuals (mean age 38.6 ± 10 years old) known to carry (carriers; n=25) or be at 50% risk for inheriting ADAD but not carrying the mutation (noncarriers; n=14). MEASUREMENTS: Individuals completed the motor and cognitive batteries from the National Institute of Health Toolbox (NIHTB) and the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). All models included effects for age, education, primary language, and sex. RESULTS: Compared to noncarriers, ADAD mutation carriers had significantly weaker grip strength at 12 years, worse manual dexterity at 10 years, and slower gait speed seven years before the expected age of dementia diagnosis. Worse motor ability was associated with a more severe cognitive disease stage and worse CASI performance, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the utility of motor performance, precisely grip strength, manual dexterity, and gait speed as potential biomarkers of preclinical AD.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
40472196,Neuroinflammatory chemokine networks in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease: A comparative multi-compartmental analysis.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) progression is critically modulated by neuroinflammatory cascades involving chemokine-mediated glial activation.ObjectiveThis study aimed to systematically compare compartment-specific chemokine signatures between two distinct AD mouse models (2×Tg-AD [APPswe/PS1dE9] and 3×Tg-AD [APPswe/PS1M146V/TauP301L]), hypothesizing that differential chemokine expression patterns would emerge in a model- and brain region-specific manner, correlating with glial activation profiles.ResultsUsing a Luminex liquid suspension chip assay, we quantified 22 chemokines in serum and brain tissues from transgenic and non-transgenic controls, complemented by Western blot analysis of microglial and astrocytic markers. Twenty-two chemokines were quantitatively analyzed with three key findings: First, serum analysis revealed elevated levels of (i) CCL11, CCL17, CCL24, CCL27, and CXCL12 in 3×Tg-AD versus non-Tg mice; (ii) CCL22 in 2×Tg-AD versus non-Tg mice; and (iii) CCL5, CCL11, CCL17, CCL24, CCL27, and CXCL12 in 3×Tg-AD versus 2×Tg-AD mice. Second, hippocampal changes showed upregulation of CCL3/CCL12 in 2×Tg-AD and CXCL16 in 3×Tg-AD mice, with cortical alterations demonstrating distinct CCL3/CCL12/CCL4 increases in 2×Tg-AD versus elevated CCL1/CXCL13 in 3×Tg-AD mice. Third, Western blot confirmed enhanced hippocampal microglial activation specifically in 3×Tg-AD mice. ConclusionOur findings establish model-specific chemokine signatures that differentially engage neuroinflammatory pathways, suggesting that 3×Tg-AD mice may better replicate human AD's complex chemokine-glia interactions. This compartmentalized profiling provides a framework for targeting chemokine networks in model-specific therapeutic development and biomarker discovery. Further studies are needed to determine whether elevated chemokine expression directly contributes to microglial activation.",Human & experimental toxicology
40297494,Cerebrospinal fluid levels of tumour necrosis factor-α and its receptors are not associated with disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Two receptors exist for TNF-α: TNF receptors 1 (TNFR-1) and 2 (TNFR-2). TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 have been reported to be involved in pleiotropic functions. Multiple lines of evidence implicate TNF-α and its receptors as potential risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies are warranted to assess the association of TNF-α, TNFR-1, and TNFR-2 with AD pathogenesis and whether they can serve as prognostic biomarkers indicative of AD. METHODS: In the present study, baseline levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TNF-α, TNFR-1, and TNFR-2 were explored, and their potential as biomarkers to differentiate between individuals who remain stable and those who experience disease progression over 10 years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was assessed. The study also examined the correlation between baseline CSF proteins with established AD biomarkers, neuroimaging measures, and cognition. RESULTS: Whilst the present study shows associations between baseline CSF levels of TNFs with AD biomarkers, the nature of the relationship is ambiguous. DISCUSSION: The present study concludes that CSF TNFs do not serve as reliable or robust disease biomarkers of AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40020758,Diagnosing preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease with visual atrophy scales in the clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND:  Visual atrophy scales from the medial temporal region are auxiliary biomarkers of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, they may correlate with progression from cognitively unimpaired (CU) status to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and they become a valuable tool for diagnostic accuracy. OBJECTIVE:  To compare the medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and entorhinal cortex atrophy (ERICA) scores measured through magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans as a useful method for probable AD diagnosis regarding clinical diagnosis and amyloid positron-emission tomography (PET). METHODS:  Two neurologists blinded to the diagnoses classified 113 older adults (age > 65 years) through the MTA and ERICA scores. We investigated the correlations involving these scores and sociodemographic data, amyloid brain cortical burden measured through PET imaging with (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B (11C-PIB PET), and clinical cognitive status, in individuals diagnosed as CU (CU; N = 30), presenting mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 52), and AD patients (N = 31). RESULTS:  The inter-rater reliability of the atrophy scales was excellent (0.8-1) according to the Cohen analysis. The CU group presented lower MTA scores (median value: 0) than ERICA (median value: 1) scores in both hemispheres. The 11C-PIB-PET was positive in 45% of the sample. In the MCI and AD groups, the ERICA score presented greater sensitivity, and the MTA score presented greater specificity. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis was sufficient and no more than 70% for both scores in AD. CONCLUSION:  In the present study, we found moderate sensitivity for the ERICA score, which could be a better screening tool than the MTA score for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. However, none of the scores were useful imaging biomarkers in preclinical AD.",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria
40462860,Brain glymphatic fluid mapping in Alzheimer's disease: a human MRI and PET study.,"Glymphatic system has been identified as a fluid exchange network in brain parenchymal for removal of toxic metabolites in Alzheimer's disease. However, a clinically feasible, accurate, and non-invasive imaging technique for mapping global glymphatic fluid distribution throughout the entire brain and monitoring its dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease is currently lacking. This cross-sectional retrospective study aims to compare three MRI-based measures of the glymphatic system structural alterations, a novel multi-echo T2 relaxometry-based parenchymal CSF (pCSF) mapping, T2 weighted-based segmented perivascular space burden, and diffusion tensor imaging-based free-water mapping. We evaluated their cross-correlation and investigated their respective association with PET measured beta-amyloid deposition using (11)C-PiB PET. A total of 29 subjects (18 Female, age: 70.07 ± 8.73 years old), among them, 16 were cognitively normal and 13 were mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, underwent both MRI and (11)C-PiB PET scans. Parenchymal CSF mapping, diffusion-based free-water mapping and perivascular spaces burden were generated from their respective MRI. Age and sex effects and group differences of these biomarkers were evaluated. The associations among these measures and Aβ deposition on (11)C-PiB PET were analysed and compared. Our analysis demonstrated moderate correlations between pCSF, diffusion-based free-water mapping and perivascular space burden, suggesting these biomarkers capture overlapping yet distinct aspects of glymphatic fluid distribution. Importantly, linear regression analyses revealed that pCSF exhibited a significantly stronger positive association with beta-amyloid deposition (white matter: t = 3.536, P = 0.002, R (2) = 0.446; Alzheimer's disease-related meta regions: t = 4.510, P < 0.001, R (2) = 0.541), compared with diffusion-based free-water mapping in white matter (t = 0.843, P = 0.407, R (2) = 0.191) and perivascular space burden (t = 0.422, P = 0.677, R (2) = 0.174), after adjusting for age and sex. This study identifies pCSF mapping, derived from multi-echo T2 data with clinically feasible 5 mins scan FAST-T2 sequence, as a potential non-invasive imaging biomarker for assessing glymphatic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The superior sensitivity of pCSF mapping arises from its direct quantification of glymphatic fluid at the water molecular level based on free CSF-specific T2 relaxation properties. These results suggest that pCSF could be useful in the monitoring of Alzheimer's disease progression as beta-amyloid accumulating and predicting response to anti-amyloid therapies, potentially leading to better diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions of Alzheimer's disease.",Brain communications
39863324,Distinct CSF α-synuclein aggregation profiles associated with Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and MCI-to-AD conversion.,"BACKGROUND: α-Synuclein (α-Syn) pathology is present in 30-50 % of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and its interactions with tau proteins may further exacerbate pathological changes in AD. However, the specific role of different aggregation forms of α-Syn in the progression of AD remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between various aggregation types of CSF α-Syn and Alzheimer's disease progression. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to examine the association between different α-Syn aggregation forms-Syn0 (no detectable α-Syn aggregates) and Syn1 (α-Syn aggregates detected, resembling those found in Parkinson's disease)-with the pathological and clinical features of AD. Additionally, we evaluated their potential as predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. SETTING: The ADNI database. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 250 participants, including 70 cognitively normal controls, 119 patients diagnosed with MCI, and 61 patients diagnosed with AD. MEASUREMENTS: Pearson correlation was employed to assess the relationship between α-Syn levels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid-β(42) (Aβ(42)). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were applied, adjusting for APOE4 status, age, and sex, to determine the association between α-Syn forms and AD-related pathological and clinical outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of different α-Syn aggregation states in predicting the conversion from MCI to AD. RESULTS: Compared with controls, overall MCI and AD patients had elevated α-Syn levels. Notably, in the α-Syn0 group, α-Syn levels were increased in the MCI patients and further increased in AD patients, whereas in the α-Syn1 group, α-Syn levels did not significantly differ across diagnostic groups. Both in the α-Syn0 and α-Syn1 groups, α-Syn levels were found to correlate more strongly with CSF tau levels than with Aβ(42), indicating a possible role for α-Syn in tau-related pathology in AD. Importantly, α-Syn0-AD patients exhibited more rapid cognitive decline and greater hippocampal atrophy than α-Syn1-AD patients. However, MCI patients with CSF α-Syn1 aggregation status had an increased risk of conversion to AD. CONCLUSIONS: CSF α-Syn is associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The distinct aggregation profiles of α-Syn serve as valuable biomarkers, offering insights into differing prognoses in AD and aiding in the prediction of early disease progression.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39895108,Correlation between serum YKL-40 and VILIP 1 levels and brain volume in dementia patients.,"AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive cognitive disorder characterized by prominent episodic memory impairment. The contribution of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation to this process has been investigated by measuring various substances. Two of the most promising substances in serum and plasma studies are visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) and tyrosine (Y), lysine (K), leucine (L)-40 (YKL-40). These markers may lead to early diagnosis and new treatment options. METHODS: Serum VILIP-1 and YKL-40 levels were analyzed in 33 probable AD patients and 23 healthy controls. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for volumetric measurements. The results were compared with the control group and then the correlation analyze between markers and volumetric measurements of the patient group was achieved. RESULTS: The right and left hippocampus and amygdala, left medial temporal, right rostral anterior cingulate, total brain, cortex, white matter, gray matter, subcortical gray matter, right and left total cortex volumes of the probable AD group were significantly lower than those of the control group. In the correlation analysis, the YKL-40 level and left posterior cingulate volume and the VILIP-1 level and left amygdala volume were negatively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: In AD, there is atrophy of the limbic structures, cortex, and white matter. While the relationship between these regions and neurodegenerative markers remains unclear, our findings highlight a notable correlation between YKL-40 and VILIP-1 levels and the left amygdala and left posterior cingulate cortex, respectively.

39850631,Clinical characteristics and biomarker profile in early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: the Shanghai Memory Study.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease constitutes ∼5-10% of Alzheimer's disease. Its clinical characteristics and biomarker profiles are not well documented. To compare the characteristics covering clinical, neuropsychological and biomarker profiles between patients with early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, we enrolled 203 patients (late-onset Alzheimer's disease = 99; early-onset Alzheimer's disease = 104) from a Chinese hospital-based cohort, the Shanghai Memory Study. A full panel of plasma biomarkers under the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration framework including plasma amyloid beta 40, amyloid beta 42, total-tau, neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau 181 were assayed using ultra-sensitive Simoa technology. Seventy-five patients underwent an amyloid molecular positron emission tomography scan whereas 43 received comprehensive amyloid, Tau deposition and hypometabolism analysis. Clinical features, plasma and imaging biomarkers were compared cross-sectionally. Compared to those with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease presented more severe impairment in language function, lower frequency of APOE ɛ4 and lower levels of plasma neurofilament light chain (all P < 0.05). The plasma phosphorylated tau 181 concentration and phosphorylated tau 181/amyloid beta 42 ratios were higher in early-onset Alzheimer's disease than in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (all P < 0.05). More severe Tau deposition as indicated by (18)F-florzolotau binding in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus was observed in the early-onset Alzheimer's disease group. Plasma phosphorylated tau 181 was associated with earlier age at onset and domain-specific cognitive impairment, especially in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. We concluded that patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease differed from late-onset Alzheimer's disease in cognitive performance and biomarker profile. A higher burden of pathological tau was observed in early-onset Alzheimer's disease and was associated with earlier age at onset and more profound cognitive impairment.",Brain communications
39747269,Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study on cerebrovascular reactivity changes in the precuneus of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline, ultimately culminating in dementia. This study aims to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and functional connectivity (FC) in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), bypassing the requirement for hypercapnia. The study cohort comprised 53 AD patients, 38 MCI patients, and 39 normal control (NC) subjects. CVR is derived by extracting signals within specific frequency bands of rs-fMRI. This study compares the differences in CVR and FC among the three groups, using the brain regions with CVR differences as region of interest (ROI) for FC analysis. The correlation between CVR and FC and cognitive scale score was discussed. Compared with NC subjects, AD patients exhibited a decrease in CVR in the PCUN.L, whereas MCI patients showed an increase in CVR in the PCUN.R. With PCUN.L as ROI, FC in PCUN.R decreased in AD patients, and FC in SFGmed.R and other brain regions increased in MCI patients compared with NC subjects. The results of the correlation analysis indicate that CVR in all patients, as well as FC with the PCUN.L as the ROI to the PCUN.R and SFGmed.R, show positive correlations with MMSE and MoCA scores. These results suggest that there are significant differences between CVR and FC with CVR differential brain regions as ROI among the AD, MCI, and NC groups, which may help to explain the hemodynamic mechanism. CVR obtained with rs-fMRI may be a potential biomarker for assessing cognitive impairment.",Scientific reports
39862333,Quantifying natural amyloid plaque accumulation in the continuum of Alzheimer's disease using ADNI.,"Brain amyloid beta neuritic plaque accumulation is associated with an increased risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) [Pfeil, J., et al. in Neurobiol Aging 106: 119-129, 2021]. Several studies estimate rates of change in amyloid plaque over time in clinically heterogeneous cohorts with different factors impacting amyloid plaque accumulation from ADNI and AIBL [Laccarino, L., et al. in Annals Clin and Trans Neurol 6: 1113 1120, 2019, Vos, S.J., et al. in Brain 138: 1327-1338, 2015, Lim, Y.Y., et al. in Alzheimer's Dementia 9: 538-545, 2013], but there are no reports using non-linear mixed effect model for amyloid plaque progression over time similar to that existing of disease-modifying biomarkers for other diseases [Cook, S.F. and R.R. Bies in Current Pharmacol Rep 2: 221-230, 2016, Gueorguieva, I., et al. in Alzheimer's Dementia 19: 2253-2264, 2023]. This study describes the natural progression of amyloid accumulation with population mean and between-participant variability for baseline and intrinsic progression rates quantified across the AD spectrum. 1340 ADNI participants were followed over a 10-year period with (18)F-florbetapir PET scans used for amyloid plaque detection. Non-linear mixed effect with stepwise covariate modelling (scm) was used. Change in natural amyloid plaque levels over 10 year period followed an exponential growth model with an intrinsic rate of approx. 3 centiloid units/year. Age, gender, APOE4 genotype and disease stage were important factors on the baseline in the natural amyloid model. In APOE4 homozygous carriers mean baseline amyloid was increased compared to APOE4 non carriers. These results demonstrate natural progression of amyloid plaque in the continuum of AD.",Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
39813057,Age- and Sex-Specific Regulation of Serine Racemase in the Retina of an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse.,"PURPOSE: Changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may have measurable effects on the retina, which may facilitate early detection due to the eye's accessibility. Retinal pathology and the regulation of serine racemase (SR) were investigated in the retinas of APP(SW)/PS1(∆E9) mice. METHODS: SR in the retinas and the content of D-serine in the aqueous humor were analyzed. The structure and function of the retina were assessed. Additionally, the regulation of SR in primary Müller cell cultures was investigated. RESULTS: SR levels were significantly higher in the retinas of 18- and 24-month-old male APP/PS1 mice, whereas aqueous humor D-serine was lower in 24-month-old APP/PS1 male mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Neither Aβ nor 17β-estradiol increased SR, but the combination of both did in Müller cell cultures. In contrast, 17β-estradiol increased Srr mRNA in the cultures. At 8 months of age, male APP/PS1 mice began to display reduced b-wave amplitude in scotopic and photopic electroretinography (ERG) recordings, unlike female APP/PS1 mice. Although the retinal layer thickness in APP/PS1 mice did not differ from WT mice, there was overt apoptosis in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the APP/PS1 mice retinas. CONCLUSIONS: The age- and sex-specific regulation of SR is correlated with the pathology of an AD retina. Because the time window for SR regulation and D-serine alteration occurs after photoreceptor dysfunction in the AD retinas, it has limited value as a detection biomarker but may be useful as a topographic biomarker for staging severity and monitoring drug interventions in the eye or central nervous system.",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science
39777990,The Taiwan-ADNI workflow toward integrating plasma p-tau217 into prediction models for the risk of Alzheimer's disease and tau burden.,"INTRODUCTION: We integrated plasma biomarkers from the Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and propose a workflow to identify individuals showing amyloid-positive positron emission tomography (PET) with low/intermediate tau burden based on [18F]Florzolotau PET-based quantification. METHODS: We assessed 361 participants across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD continuum and measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels at two medical centers. We evaluated the diagnostic potential of these biomarkers. RESULTS: Among all plasma biomarkers, p-tau217 had the highest consistency with amyloid PET results (area under the curve = 0.94), and a cutoff value could have reduced the number of confirmatory amyloid PET scans by 57.5%. In amyloid PET-positive cases intending to use anti-amyloid therapy, p-tau217 level, along with clinical parameters, had the highest predictive ability for low/intermediate tau burden. DISCUSSION: A two-step workflow based on p-tau217 and confirmatory amyloid PET could accurately classify AD patients showing low/intermediate tau burden. HIGHLIGHTS: The emergence of anti-amyloid therapy increases the need to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of plasma biomarkers, especially phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), can help in the diagnosis of AD. P-tau217 is a better predictor of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) positivity than other core biomarkers. In amyloid PET-positive individuals, p-tau217 can predict tau burden. We propose a two-step workflow to identify AD cases suitable for treatment.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

All participants underwent (18)F-florzolotau PET, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and plasma biomarker investigation (total and phosphorylated tau [pTau181], neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]).Results(18)F-Florzolotau uptake was significantly higher in the subcortical regions of the pallidum, subthalamic nucleus (STN), midbrain, red nucleus, and raphe nucleus in PSP patients compared to the other groups (all p < 0.01). Subcortical tau tracer retention assisted in distinguishing PSP and CBS from controls (AUC = 0.836, p < 0.001). Tau tracer retention could differentiate PSP and CBS from AD in cortical (p < 0.001) and subcortical regions (p = 0.028). The motor severity of PSP positively correlated with tau burden in STN (p = 0.044) and substantia nigra (p = 0.035). Tau tracer uptake was associated with cortical volume changes in CBS (p = 0.031), PSP non-Richardson syndrome (p = 0.003), and AD (p = 0.044). Cortical tau retention correlated with plasma levels of GFAP (p = 0.001) and pTau181 (p = 0.036).ConclusionsSubcortical (18)F-Florzolotau uptake assist the diagnosis of 4R tauopathy parkinsonism. Additionally, regional tau burden contributes to structural brain volume changes and correlates with plasma levels of GFAP and pTau181.",Journal of Parkinson's disease
39908635,Unveiling Alzheimer's disease through brain age estimation using multi-kernel regression network and magnetic resonance imaging.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have unveiled age-related anatomical changes across various brain regions. The disparity between actual age and estimated age, known as the Brain-Predicted Age Difference (Brain-PAD), serves as an indicator for predicting neurocognitive ailments or brain abnormalities resulting from diseases. This study aims to develop an accurate brain age prediction model that can assist in identifying potential neurocognitive impairments. METHODS: The present study implemented a brain age prediction model using a ResNet-50 deep network and a multi-kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) regression network, relying on MRI images. Kernel methods translate input information into higher-dimensional space by introducing nonlinearity and enabling the model to grasp complicated data patterns. A multi-kernel function combines the Gaussian and polynomial kernels and is incorporated into the brain age regression model. The model effectively utilizes the benefits of both kernel functions to estimate the ages accurately. MRI scans are segmented into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) maps preprocessed and extracted of significant features using the ResNet-50 deep network. Extracted features of the WM and GM datasets are fed into the MKELM regression model for brain age prediction. RESULTS: The proposed age estimation framework achieved 3.06 years of mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.12 years of root mean square error (RMSE) on healthy controls (HC) WM scans, and on GM scans, 2.73 years of MAE and 3.65 years of RMSE values. To further validate the importance of Brain-PAD as a biomarker for identifying brain health conditions, an independent testing dataset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects age is predicted. The Brain-PAD values for AD subjects' GM images are significantly higher compared to those of HC and MCI subjects, indicating distinct brain health conditions. Furthermore, variations in GM and WM tissue were identified in AD subjects, revealing that the parahippocampus and corpus callosum were notably affected. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential of Brain-PAD as a significant biomarker for assessing brain health, with implications for early detection of neurocognitive diseases. The developed framework effectively estimates brain age using MRI, contributing valuable insights into the relationship between brain structure and cognitive health.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine
39863332,Identifying proteomic prognostic markers for Alzheimer's disease with survival machine learning: The Framingham Heart Study.,"BACKGROUND: Protein abundance levels, sensitive to both physiological changes and external interventions, are useful for assessing the Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and treatment efficacy. However, identifying proteomic prognostic markers for AD is challenging by their high dimensionality and inherent correlations. METHODS: Our study analyzed 1128 plasma proteins, measured by the SOMAscan platform, from 858 participants 55 years and older (mean age 63 years, 52.9 % women) of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. We conducted regression analysis and machine learning models, including LASSO-based Cox proportional hazard regression model (LASSO) and generalized boosted regression model (GBM), to identify protein prognostic markers. These markers were used to construct a weighted proteomic composite score, the AD prediction performance of which was assessed using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). The association between the composite score and memory domain was examined in 339 (of the 858) participants with available memory scores, and in a separate group of 430 participants younger than 55 years (mean age 46, 56.7 % women). RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 20 years, 132 (15.4 %) participants developed AD. After adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 + status, regression models identified 309 proteins (P ≤ 0.2). After applying machine learning methods, nine of these proteins were selected to develop a composite score. This score improved AD prediction beyond the factors of age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 + status across 15-25 years of follow-up, achieving its peak AUC of 0.84 in the LASSO model at the 22-year follow-up. It also showed a consistent negative association with memory scores in the 339 participants (beta = -0.061, P = 0.046), 430 participants (beta = -0.060, P = 0.018), and the pooled 769 samples (beta = -0.058, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the utility of machine learning method in identifying proteomic markers in improving AD prediction and emphasize the complex pathology of AD. The composite score may aid early AD detection and efficacy monitoring, warranting further validation in diverse populations.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39713891,Association of APOE alleles and polygenic profiles comprising APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 variants with Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging markers.,"INTRODUCTION: TOMM40 and APOC1 variants can modulate the APOE-ε4-related Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by up to fourfold. We aim to investigate whether the genetic modulation of ε4-related AD risk is reflected in brain morphology. METHODS: We tested whether 27 magnetic resonance imaging-derived neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration (volume and thickness in temporo-limbic regions) are associated with APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 polygenic profiles using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set linked to the AD Genetic Consortium data. RESULTS: All brain regions studied using structural phenotypes were smaller in individuals with AD. The ε4 allele was associated with smaller limbic (entorhinal, hippocampus, parahippocampus) brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cases than controls. There were significant differences in the associations for the higher-risk and lower-risk ε4-bearing APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 profiles with temporo-limbic region markers. DISCUSSION: The APOE-AD heterogeneity may be partly attributed to the modulating role of the TOMM40 and APOC1 genes in the APOE cluster. HIGHLIGHTS: The ε4 allele is associated with smaller values of neuroimaging markers in AD cases. Larger values of neuroimaging markers may protect against AD in the ε4 carriers. TOMM40 and APOC1 variants differentiate AD risk in the ε4 carriers. The same variants can differentiate the links between ε4 and neuroimaging markers.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39473263,Circulating medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines are associated with plasma P-tau181 in cognitively normal older adults.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves dysregulation in diverse biochemical processes. Nevertheless, plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181), a recognised AD biomarker, has been described to reflect early-stage cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in cognitively normal (CN) adults. Therefore, identifying changes in plasma metabolites associated with plasma P-tau181 at the pre-clinical stage may provide insights into underlying biochemical mechanisms to better understand initial AD pathogenesis. In the current study, plasma P-tau181, quantified via single molecule array (Simoa) technology, and plasma metabolites, quantified via targeted-mass spectrometry, were investigated for associations in CN older adults and upon stratification by positron emission tomography (PET)-Aβ load. In addition, the P-tau181-linked metabolites were evaluated for cognitive performance and neuroimaging markers of AD and the potential to distinguish between CN Aβ- and CN Aβ+ individuals. Significant positive associations of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines (ACs) were observed with P-tau181 in the entire cohort, CN Aβ- and CN Aβ+, suggesting a link between initial Aβ pathology and fatty acid oxidation-mediated energy metabolism pathways. However, in CN Aβ-, additional linear associations of P-tau181 were observed with muscle metabolism and nitric oxide homeostasis-associated metabolites. Upon investigating the P-tau181-linked metabolites for cognitive performance, significant inverse correlations of the verbal and visual episodic memory and the global composite score were noted in CN Aβ+ with medium- and long-chain ACs, suggesting prognostic value of ACs accompanying weaker cognitive performance. While investigating neuroimaging markers, ACs had positive associations with PET-Aβ load and inverse associations with hippocampal volume in CN Aβ+, indicating connections of ACs with initial AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, based on receiver operating characteristics analysis, the associated ACs potentially classified PET-Aβ status in older adults. Therefore, plasma P-tau181-linked circulating ACs may serve as potential prognostic markers for initial AD pathogenesis in CN older adults. However, further cross-sectional and longitudinal research in highly characterised AD cohorts is needed to validate current findings.",Journal of neurochemistry
39873881,Highly specific amyloid and tau PET ligands for ATN classification in suspected Alzheimer's disease patients.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to accurately classify ATN profiles using highly specific amyloid and tau PET ligands and MRI in patients with cognitive impairment and suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD). It also aims to explore the relationship between quantified amyloid and tau deposition and cognitive function. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (15 women and 12 men; age range: 64-81 years) were included in this study. Amyloid and tau PET scans were performed using (18)F-NAV4694 and (18)F-MK6240, respectively. For each patient, amyloid and tau PET images were visually assessed and classified as either amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative, and as (18)F-MK6240 Braak stage 0 (tau-negative) or Braak stages I-VI (tau-positive). Voxel-based morphometry of three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI was used to evaluate neurodegeneration. Amyloid and tau depositions were quantified using the Centiloid scale and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), respectively. Global cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: Patients were categorized into seven ATN profiles. Six patients (22%) exhibited a normal AD biomarker profile, 15 patients (56%) fell within the Alzheimer's continuum, and 14 patients (52%) were diagnosed with AD. Additionally, six patients (22%) displayed non-AD pathological changes. Positive and negative findings of amyloid and tau PET were concordant in 24 patients (89%). Among the 14 patients diagnosed with AD, the Centiloid scale for amyloid deposition did not show a significant negative correlation with MMSE scores (r = 0.269, p = 0.451). In contrast, the SUVR for tau deposition in the neocortex exhibited a significant negative correlation (r = -0.689, p = 0.014), while tau deposition in the mesial temporal region did not show a significant correlation (r = 0.158, p = 0.763). CONCLUSION: Highly specific amyloid and tau PET scans, along with MRI, can be utilized to accurately classify ATN profiles in patients with cognitive impairment and suspected AD. The discordance in amyloid and tau PET findings in three patients allowed for a more precise AD diagnosis. Furthermore, tau PET imaging provided insight into the propagation of tau deposition in the neocortex beyond the mesial temporal region, which is associated with cognitive decline.",Annals of nuclear medicine
39859545,Comparison of Methods of Detecting IL-1β in the Blood of Alzheimer's Disease Subjects.,"Interleukin (IL)-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose levels are increased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Despite the role of IL-1β in the pathology of AD, the fact that it is expressed at very low levels makes it a challenging cytokine to measure, hence limiting its potential use as a reliable biomarker. Moreover, being able to accurately and reliably measure the levels of IL-1 β in blood makes it possible to evaluate this cytokine as a potential biomarker of the inflammatory response in AD. In this study, we compared three quantification methodologies, Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD), both V-Plex and S-Plex versions, and Quanterix's SIMOA (Single-Molecule Array), to measure IL-1β in the serum of AD patients and age-matched controls. These assays are routinely used to measure IL-1β serum levels with high specificity and sensitivity in human AD patients, yet to the best of our knowledge, no study has compared all three techniques for their accuracy to measure IL-1β as biomarkers. Our findings indicate the two MSD assays can be used to measure IL-1β levels in AD and control serum, but the SIMOA assay showed the highest receiver operating characteristics (ROCs), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9532, which can be compared to the AUC values for the V-Plex assay, 0.5660, and the S-Plex assay, 0.6632. Taken together, these data show that although all technologies are useful in the measurement of IL-1β in the blood, the SIMOA IL-1β 3.0 assay is more reliable and sensitive in measuring biomarkers of AD.",International journal of molecular sciences
38315405,Bioinformatics to analyze the differentially expressed genes in different degrees of Alzheimer's disease and their roles in progress of the disease.,"Employing bioinformatics approaches, this investigation pinpointed pivotal differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD), from incipient to severe stages, using the GSE28146 dataset from the GEO repository. Analytical methods included DEG identification via the limma package in R, coupled with GO and KEGG pathway analyses through clusterProfiler, to discern biological processes and pathway involvements. Key findings spotlighted the roles of proteasome subunits PSMB4, PSMB8, PSMC4, and PSMD6 in the early stage, ribosomal proteins RPS3 and RPL11 during moderate AD, and mitochondrial components COX5B, COX6B2, and COX7A2 in severe AD, underscoring their importance in the disease's pathogenesis. Conclusively, these results not only delineate the dynamic genetic shifts accompanying AD progression but also propose critical biomarkers for potential therapeutic targeting, offering a consolidated basis for future AD research and treatment development. This offered a novel idea for analyzing the pathogenesis and development of AD and investigation of targeted drugs.",Journal of applied genetics
39549282,Associations Between Deficit Accumulation Frailty and Baseline Markers of Lifestyle in the U.S. POINTER Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Multidomain lifestyle interventions may have the potential to slow biological aging as captured by deficit accumulation frailty indices. We describe the distribution and composition of the 49-component frailty index developed by the U.S. POINTER clinical trial team of investigators and assess its cross-sectional associations with sociodemographic factors and markers chosen to be representative of behaviors targeted by the trial's multidomain interventions. METHODS: We draw baseline data from the 2 111 volunteers enrolled in U.S. POINTER who were ages 60-79 years and at increased risk for cognitive decline. Frailty components were grouped into 9 domains. Associations that frailty index scores and their domains had with behavioral markers were described with correlations and canonical correlation. RESULTS: The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the frailty index score distribution were 0.153, 0.189, and 0.235. Higher frailty scores tended to occur among individuals who were older, male, and living in areas of greater deprivation (all p < .001). They were also associated with poorer self-reported diet, less physical activity, and higher Framingham risk scores (all p < .001). Associations were diffusely distributed among the frailty component domains, indicating that no individual domain was dominating associations. CONCLUSIONS: The U.S. POINTER deficit accumulation frailty index had expected relationships with sociodemographic factors and sensitivity to the behaviors targeted by the trial's interventions. Our analysis supports its use as a secondary outcome to assess whether the multidomain interventions differentially impact an established marker of biological aging.

39692476,Curation and validation of electronic medical record-based dementia diagnoses in the VA Million Veteran Program.,"BACKGROUND: The age distribution and diversity of the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort make it a valuable resource for studying the genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). OBJECTIVE: We present and evaluate the performance of several International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based classification algorithms for AD, ADRD, and dementia for use in MVP genetic studies and other studies using VA electronic medical record (EMR) data. These were benchmarked relative to existing ICD algorithms and AD-medication-identified cases. METHODS: We used chart review of n = 103 MVP participants to evaluate diagnostic utility of the algorithms. Suitability for genetic studies was examined by assessing association with APOE ε4, the strongest genetic AD risk factor, in a large MVP cohort (n = 286 K). RESULTS: The newly developed MVP-ADRD algorithm performed well, comparable to the existing PheCode dementia algorithm (Phe-Dementia) in terms of sensitivity (0.95 and 0.95) and specificity (0.65 and 0.70). The strongest APOE ε4 associations were observed in cases identified using MVP-ADRD and Phe-Dementia augmented with medication-identified cases (MVP-ADRD or medication, p = 3.6 ×10(-290); Phe-Dementia or medication, p = 1.4 ×10(-290)). Performance was improved when cases were restricted to those with onset age ≥60. CONCLUSIONS: We found that our MVP-developed ICD-based algorithms had good performance in chart review and generated strong genetic signals, especially after inclusion of medication-identified cases. Ultimately, our MVP-derived algorithms are likely to have good performance in the broader VA, and their performance may also be suitable for use in other large-scale EMR-based biobanks in the absence of definitive biomarkers such as amyloid-PET and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39887916,Predicting conversion in cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment individuals with machine learning: Is the CSF status still relevant?,"INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) helps diagnose the mild cognitive impairment-Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) spectrum. However, ML is fed with data unavailable in standard clinical practice. Thus, we tested a novel multi-step ML approach to predict cognitive worsening. METHODS: We selected cognitively normal and MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and categorized them on total tau/amyloid beta 1-42 ratios. ML was applied to predict the 3-year conversion with standard clinical data (SCD), assess the model's accuracy, and identify the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in this approach. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out to explore the automated decisional process. RESULTS: The model achieved 84% accuracy across the entire cohort, 86% in patients with negative CSF, and 88% in individuals with AD-like CSF. SHAP analysis identified differences between CSF-positive and -negative patients in predictors of conversion and cut-offs. CONCLUSIONS: The approach yielded good prediction accuracy using SCD. However, CSF-based categorizations are needed to improve predictive accuracy. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning algorithms can predict cognitive decline with standard and routinely used clinical data. Classification according to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers enhances prediction accuracy. Different cut-offs could be applied to neuropsychological tests to predict conversion.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
40338932,Cognitive decline in older adults with type 2 diabetes: Unraveling site-specific glycoproteomic alterations.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is consistently related to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. However, the molecular underpinnings of this association remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied a novel mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomic methodology to profile serum glycoproteins in older adults with T2D, aiming to identify glycopeptiforms associated with cognitive impairment. Our method allowed comprehensive profiling of N glycosylation in addition to the unique ability to profile glycation events on specific amino acid sites. Serum samples from initially cognitively normal older adults with T2D were collected, with participants classified as cognitive decliners (who developed impairment) and non-decliners (who maintained normal cognition over time). We identified significant differences in the abundance of glycopeptiforms between these groups, noting that certain glycopeptiforms exhibited unique changes over time in decliners. We identified 13 glycopeptiforms that exhibited significant differences between the groups both at baseline and in their rates of change over time. Pathway analysis indicated that glycation events were linked to metabolic pathways while glycosylation to immune-related pathways, aligning with established links between these processes and cognitive decline. This study offers new insights into glycoproteoform alterations in older adults with T2D experiencing cognitive decline. It highlights the potential of specific glycopeptiforms as biomarkers for early cognitive impairment in T2D. Further validation in larger cohorts will enhance our understanding of glycosylation and glycation in T2D and potentially lead to the discovery of novel treatment targets for T2D-related cognitive decline.

39919076,Characterization of gene expression profiles in Alzheimer's disease and osteoarthritis: A bioinformatics study.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Osteoarthritis (OA) have been shown to have a close association in previous studies, but the pathogenesis of both diseases are unclear. This study explores the potential common molecular mechanisms between AD and OA through bioinformatics analysis, providing new insights for clinical treatment strategies. METHODS: The AD and OA-related datasets were downloaded from the gene expression database GEO. The datasets were analyzed to obtain differentially expressed gene (DEG) datasets for OA and AD, respectively. The intersection of these DEGs was analyzed to identify common DEGs (Co-DEGs). Subsequently, the Co-DEGs were enriched, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify core genes. The expression of these genes was validated in a separate dataset, and their diagnostic value for the diseases was analyzed. In addition, the core genes were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis and single-gene genome variation analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of DEGs on gene chips from OA and AD patients revealed significant changes in gene expression patterns. Notably, EFEMP2 and TSPO, genes associated with inflammatory responses, showed lower expression levels in both AD and OA patients, suggesting a downregulation in the pathological backgrounds of these diseases. Additionally, GABARAPL1, which is crucial for the maturation of autophagosomes, was found to be upregulated in both conditions. These findings suggest the potential of these genes as diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, to confirm the effectiveness of these genes as therapeutic targets, more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed in the future, particularly to explore the feasibility and specific mechanisms of combating disease progression by regulating the expression of these genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that AD and OA shares common molecular mechanisms. The identification of EFEMP2, GABARAPL1, and TSPO as key target genes highlights potential common factors in both diseases. Further investigation into these findings could lead to new candidate targets and treatment directions for AD and OA, offering promising avenues for developing more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions.",PloS one
39751793,Therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells on cholesterol homeostasis-associated genes in AD-like rats.,"Cholesterol is vital for nerve processes. Changes in cholesterol homeostasis lead to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, extensive research has confirmed the influential role of adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in managing AD. The present study aims is to investigate a new approach concerning AD by MSCs with particular reference to the cholesterol homeostasis pathway and its regulatory miRNAs in an AD-like rat model. Three groups of 24 male Wistar rats have been divided: healthy rats (control), Alzheimer's rats (AD), and Alzheimer's rats that received MSCs (AD + MSC). Cholesterol level was measured using the GC-mass technique. The mRNA and expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and CYP46A1 genes, as well as their regulating miRNAs, were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting techniques, respectively. Intraventricular transplantation of MSCs improved behavioral disorders and decreased the count of Aβ plaques in brain tissue. Transplantation of these cells also led to a significant decrease in cholesterol levels and HMGCR, ApoE, and ABCA1 and a remarkable increase in CYP46A1 mRNAs and protein expression. These cells considerably changed the expression of microRNAs regulating these genes. These results indicated that the examined miRNAs could be used as promising biomarkers for AD management. Additionally, the potential therapeutic role of MSCs in improving cholesterol levels the expression levels of the targeted miRNAs and their related genes in the cholesterol homeostasis pathway was established.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for
39763384,Cerebral perfusion alterations in healthy young adults due to two genetic risk factors of Alzheimer's disease: APOE and MAPT.,"Functional brain changes such as altered cerebral blood flow occur long before the onset of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. While cerebral hypoperfusion occurs in established AD, middle-aged carriers of genetic risk factors for AD, including APOE ε4, display regional hyperperfusion due to hypothesised pleiotropic or compensatory effects, representing a possible early biomarker of AD and facilitating earlier AD diagnosis. However, it is not clear whether hyperperfusion already exists even earlier in life. Here, 160 young and cognitively healthy participants from the Chinese PREVENT cohort underwent 3 T arterial spin labelling and T1 MRI and genetic testing for APOE and MAPT rs242557 status. Using FSL, we performed a whole brain voxel-wise analysis and a global mean grey matter analysis comparing for the effects of both risk genes on cerebral perfusion. No significant alterations were seen for APOE genotype, but in MAPT rs242557 A carriers, we observed a significantly hyperperfusion in the left anterior cingulate cortex and left insular cortex. There were no effects of APOE or MAPT status on the global perfusion. These results are novel and may suggest that MAPT genotypes demonstrated a distinct hemodynamic profile in a very young age.",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the
39708531,Time-Frequency functional connectivity alterations in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia: An EEG analysis using machine learning.,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are prevalent neurodegenerative diseases characterized by altered brain functional connectivity (FC), affecting over 100 million people worldwide. This study aims to identify distinct FC patterns as potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis. METHODS: Resting-state EEG data from 36 AD patients, 23 FTD patients, and 29 healthy controls were analyzed using time-frequency and bandpass filtering FC metrics. These metrics were estimated through Pearson's correlations, mutual information, and phase lag index, and served as input features in a support vector machine (SVM) with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for group classification. RESULTS: Both AD and FTD exhibited significantly decreased FC in the theta band within the frontal lobe and increased FC in the beta band in the posterior regions. Additionally, a decreased FC in central regions at theta band was observed uniquely in AD, but not in FTD. SVM classification accuracies reached 95% for AD and 86% for FTD. CONCLUSIONS: High classification accuracies underscore the potential of these FC alterations as reliable biomarkers for AD and FTD. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to integrate time-frequency and bandpass filtering FC metrics to reveal brain network alterations in AD and FTD, providing new insights for diagnostics and neurodegenerative pathologies.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of
39812331,Predicting Alzheimer's disease subtypes and understanding their molecular characteristics in living patients with transcriptomic trajectory profiling.,"INTRODUCTION: Deciphering the diverse molecular mechanisms in living Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is a big challenge but is pivotal for disease prognosis and precision medicine development. METHODS: Utilizing an optimal transport approach, we conducted graph-based mapping of transcriptomic profiles to transfer AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to ADNI and ANMerge peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subsequently, differential expression followed by comparative pathway and diffusion pseudotime analysis were applied to each cohort to infer the progression trajectories. Survival analysis with real follow-up time was used to obtain potential biomarkers for AD prognosis. RESULTS: AD subtype labels were accurately transferred onto the blood samples of ADNI and ANMerge living patients. Pathways and associated genes in neutrophil degranulation-like immune process, immune acute phase response, and IL-6 signaling were significantly associated with AD progression. DISCUSSION: The work enhanced our understanding of AD progression in different subtypes, offering insights into potential biomarkers and personalized interventions for improved patient care. HIGHLIGHTS: We applied an innovative optimal transport-based approach to map transcriptomic data from different Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort studies and transfer known AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples within ADNI and ANMerge cohorts. Through comprehensive trajectory and comparative analysis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying different disease progression trajectories in AD. We validated the accuracy of our AD subtype label transfer and identified prognostic genetic markers associated with disease progression, facilitating personalized treatment strategies. By identifying and predicting distinctive AD subtypes and their associated pathways, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of AD heterogeneity.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39865688,Cognivue Clarity(®) characterizes amyloid status and preclinical Alzheimer's disease in biomarker confirmed cohorts in the Bio-Hermes Study.,"BackgroundCognivue Clarity(®) is an FDA-cleared computerized cognitive test to screen for cognitive impairment included in the Bio-Hermes Study to test blood-based and digital biomarkers' ability to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A subset of cognitively normal individuals have amyloid deposition (Preclinical AD) but no current assessment can identify these individuals in the absence of expensive biomarkers.ObjectiveWe examined differences in Cognivue Clarity performance between amyloid positive and amyloid negative individuals and whether Cognivue Clarity could differentiate True Controls (cognitively normal/amyloid negative), Preclinical AD (cognitively normal/amyloid positive), and MCI due to AD (MCI-AD, cognitively impaired/amyloid positive).MethodsCognivue Clarity was administered to all participants in the Bio-Hermes Study who also had amyloid PET and blood-based biomarkers. Performance was compared between biomarker-defined groups: True Controls (n = 297), Preclinical AD (n = 95), and MCI-AD (n = 113).ResultsCognivue Clarity global scores distinguished amyloid positive individuals from amyloid negative individuals (p < 0.001) and differentiated True Controls versus Preclinical AD (p = 0.014) and Preclinical AD versus MCI-AD (p < 0.001). Three subtests [Shape Discrimination (p = 0.004), Visual Salience (p = 0.008), Adaptive Motor Control (p = 0.004)] and the 3-test mean (p < 0.001) differentiated True Controls from Preclinical AD. The 3-test composite correlated with Amyloid PET (r = -0.433) and pTau217 (r = -0.400). The 3-test mean identified Preclinical AD in both White and Black participants.ConclusionsCognivue Clarity, a 10-min computerized battery, screens for individuals with cognitive impairment, characterizes amyloid positive individuals, and identifies Preclinical AD. This has great potential as a cost- and time-effective strategy to screen and enroll in AD prevention trials.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39206485,In-silico Studies and Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Assessment of Microencapsulated Celecoxib against Scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an enervating and chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Celecoxib (CXB) possesses efficacious antioxidants and has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. However, the poor bioavailability of CXB limits its therapeutic utility. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the microencapsulated celecoxib MCXB for neuroprotection. METHODOLOGY: CXB was screened by molecular docking study using AutoDock (version 5.2), and the following proteins, such as 4EY7, 2HM1, 2Z5X, and 1PBQ were selected for predicting its neuroprotective effect. Scopolamine 20 mg/kg/day for approximately 7 days was administered to albino rats. Pure CXB 100 mg/kg/- day and 200 mg/kg/day, and MCXB 100 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day were administered, respectively. Further, to assess the oxidative stress, the nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated using chemical methods. The neurochemical biomarkers like AChE, glutamate, and dopamine were evaluated using the ELISA method. Further, the histopathology of brain cells was carried out to assess the neuro-regeneration and neurodegeneration of the neurons. RESULTS: There was a significant binding interaction of CXB (score -6.3, -6.5, -5.1, -9.1) and donepezil (score- 5.5, -7.6, -7.0, and -8.6) with AchE (4EY7), β-secretase (2HM1, monoamine oxidase (2Z5X), and glutamate (1PBQ), respectively. MCXB-treated rats (100 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day) showed increased SOD levels (p < 0.001), whereas NO, catalase, and LPO levels were significantly (p < 0.001) decreased as compared to scopolamine-treated rats. Further, MCXB-treated rats showed a modulatory effect in the level of dopamine and AchE. However, the glutamate level was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased. CONCLUSION: In addition to that, histopathological examination of the hippocampus part showed remarkable improvement in brain cells. So, the findings of the results revealed that MCXB, in a dose-dependent manner, showed a neuroprotective effect against scopolamine-induced AD. This effect may be attributed to the activation of cholinergic pathways.",Current pharmaceutical design
39754303,Peripheral Single-Cell Immune Characteristics Contribute to the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia With Lewy Bodies.,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are common neurodegenerative diseases with distinct but overlapping pathogenic mechanisms. The clinical similarities between these diseases often result in high misdiagnosis rates, leading to serious consequences. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are easy to collect and can accurately reflect the immune characteristics of both DLB and AD. METHODS: We utilized time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) with single-cell resolution to quantitatively analyze peripheral PBMCs, identifying 1228 immune characteristics. Based on the top-selected immune features, we constructed immunological elastic net (iEN) models. RESULTS: These models demonstrated high diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing diseased samples from healthy donors as well as distinguishing AD and DLB cases. The selected features reveal that the primary peripheral immune characteristic of AD is a decrease in total T cells, while DLB is characterized by low expression of I-kappa-B-alpha (IKBα) in the classical monocyte subset. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that peripheral immune characteristics could serve as potential biomarkers, facilitating the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics
39863311,VG@nAu-based fluorescent biosensor for grading Alzheimer's disease by detecting P-tau181 protein in clinical samples.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a very long duration, posing a serious threat to people's life and health. To date, no medicine that can cure or reverse the disease has been developed or reported, so early diagnosis and timely intervention are essential. The concentration of Phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) in blood has been approved by FDA as a standard for assisting clinical diagnosis of AD. RESULTS: In this study, a fluorescence biosensor based on vertical graphene-modified nano-gold film (VG@nAu) was developed for the grading of AD diagnosis by detecting P-tau181 protein in the blood. The VG@nAu substrate that produces hundreds of times IR800 molecular compared with a glass substrate, which is prepared by sputtering nano-gold onto vertical graphene surface. The detection limit of this fluorescence biosensor for P-tau181 is 0.82 pg/mL. The sensor also shows excellent selectivity and stability. Moreover, we analyzed the levels of P-tau181 in 16 clinical samples divided into four groups (HC group, SCD group, MCI group, and AD group) and found significant differences in P-tau181 levels. The grouping result based on the detection results using this biosensor is consistent with the grouping results of the clinical doctors. SIGNIFICANCE: This study achieves ultrasensitive detection of P-tau181 protein by constructing a fluorescent biosensor, which validates the feasibility of the VG@nAu-based fluorescence biosensor for the grading of AD diagnosis. This research provides a promising tool for ultrasensitive detecting biomarkers in clinical samples, indicating significant potential for its use in related diagnosing disease.",Analytica chimica acta
39821801,"Aβ42 biomarker linked to insula, striatum, thalamus and claustrum in dementia with Lewy bodies.","The differential mechanisms between proteinopathies and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) remain unclear. To address this issue, we conducted a voxel-based morphometry and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker (α-synuclein, Aβ42, t-Tau and p-Tau(181)) level correlation study in patients with DLB, AD and mixed cases (AD + DLB). Cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained by lumbar puncture and whole-brain T1-weighted images were collected in the AlphaLewyMA cohort. Within the cohort, 65 DLB patients, 18 AD patients, 24 AD + DLB patients and 16 neurological control subjects (NC) were clinically diagnosed. Correlation analyses were performed between cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels and gray matter volumes using a voxel-based morphometry approach. A mediation analysis was performed to explore the role of gray matter volumes in the relationship between Aβ42 levels and clinical severity (MMSE scores). We observed a significant positive correlation between gray matter volumes and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels in the insula, the striatal regions, the right thalamus, and the claustrum in DLB patients (p(FDR) < 0.05). Mediation analysis revealed that gray matter volumes significantly mediated the relationship between Aβ42 levels and MMSE scores in DLB patients. We found no significant correlation with gray matter volumes for α-synuclein, p-Tau(181) or t-Tau in DLB patients (p(FDR) < 0.05). We found no significant correlations in the AD, AD + DLB and NC groups for any of the biomarkers (p(FDR) < 0.05). The specific correlation between a reduced cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 level and lower gray matter volumes in insula, striatum, thalamus, and claustrum in DLB patients suggests a prominent role for amyloidopathy in promoting brain atrophy in key regions of the disease.",GeroScience
39713882,Integrating rare pathogenic variant prioritization with gene-based association analysis to identify novel genes and relevant multimodal traits for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence has highlighted rare variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, insufficient sample sizes, especially in underrepresented ethnic groups, hinder their investigation. Additionally, their impact on endophenotypes remains largely unexplored. METHODS: We prioritized rare likely-deleterious variants based on whole-genome sequencing data from a Chinese AD cohort (n = 988). Gene-based optimal sequence kernel association tests were conducted between AD cases and normal controls to identify AD-related genes. Network clustering, endophenotype association, and cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate their functional consequences. RESULTS: We identified 11 novel AD candidate genes, which captured AD-related pathways and enhanced AD risk prediction performance. Key genes (RABEP1, VIPR1, RPL3L, and CABIN1) were linked to cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Experiments showed RABEP1 p.R845W inducing endocytosis dysregulation and exacerbating toxic amyloid β accumulation, underscoring its therapeutic potential. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the contributions of rare variants to AD and provided novel insights into AD therapeutics. HIGHLIGHTS: Identified 11 novel AD candidate genes in a Chinese AD cohort. Correlated candidate genes with AD-related cognitive and brain imaging traits. Indicated RABEP1 p.R845W as a critical AD contributor in the endocytic pathway.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39743558,Plasma phospho-tau217 as a predictive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease in a large south American cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Blood-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers have been increasingly employed for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring purposes, due to accuracy in distinguishing AD pathophysiologic process. Compared to other p-tau isoforms, plasma p-tau217 exhibits stronger associations with AD hallmarks in CSF and brain. However, most studies have been conducted in non-Hispanic Whites, limiting our understanding of the performances and utility of these biomarkers across ethnicities. METHODS: We examined a cohort of Peruvians from the GAPP study, a recently established cohort of Peruvian mestizos from Lima and indigenous groups from Southern Peru (Aymaras and Quechuas). We tested plasma levels of p-tau using the Quanterix Simoa ALZpathp-tau217 assay in 525 samples and tested the association between p-tau217 and clinical diagnosis (healthy controls n = 234 vs. AD n = 113) using generalized mixed regression models, adjusting for sex, age, education, APOE-e4 allele (fixed effects) and study site (random effect). We also tested biomarker levels in MCI (n = 178) vs. other groups. The receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the biomarker's classification performances. RESULT: Participants showed on average 80% Native American ancestry. p-tau217 was significantly associated with AD (β = 2.61, 95%CI = 0.61-4.29) and its levels were inversely correlated with cognitive performances; p-tau217 levels did not differ between controls and MCI (p-value > 0.05). p-tau217 levels were higher in participants carrying at least one APOE-e4 allele (OR = 2.31, 95%CI = 1.85-2.90). The ROC-AUC for p-tau217 was estimated at 82.82% in the fully adjusted model. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study conducted in a South American cohort phenotyped for AD with available p-tau217. Most investigations have previously focused on highly selected cohorts with established AD-endophenotypes (CSF biomarkers, autopsy report, PET etc.), while data on cohorts with clinical assessment are currently lacking, especially in non-European populations.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
38747223,Development and Assessment of a Prediction Model for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Based on Thermoregulation-Related Genes.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition among the elderly population and the most common form of dementia, however, we lack potent interventions to arrest its inherent pathogenic vectors. Robust evidence indicates thermoregulatory perturbations during and before the onset of symptoms. Therefore, temperature-regulated biomarkers may offer clues to therapeutic targets during the presymptomatic stage. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop and assess a thermoregulation-related gene prediction model for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. METHODS: This study aims to utilize microarray bioinformatic analysis to identify the potential biomarkers of AD by analyzing four microarray datasets (GSE48350, GSE5281, GSE122063, and GSE181279) of AD patients. Furthermore, thermoregulation-associated hub genes were identified, and the expression patterns in the brain were explored. In addition, we explored the infiltration of immune cells with thermoregulation-related hub genes. Diagnostic marker validation was then performed at the single-cell level. Finally, the prediction of targeted drugs was performed based on the hub genes. RESULTS: Through the analysis of four datasets pertaining to AD, a total of five genes associated with temperature regulation were identified. Notably, CCK, CXCR4, SLC27A4, and SLC17A6 emerged as diagnostic markers indicative of AD-related brain injury. Furthermore, in the examination of peripheral blood samples from AD patients, SLC27A4 and CXCR4 were identified as pivotal diagnostic indicators. Regrettably, animal experimentation was not pursued to validate the data; rather, an assessment of temperature regulation-related genes was conducted. Future investigations will be undertaken to establish the correlation between these genes and AD pathology. CONCLUSION: Overall, CCK, CXCR4, SLC27A4, and SLC17A6 can be considered pivotal biomarkers for diagnosing the pathogenesis and molecular functions of AD.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening
39936538,Mapping reactive astrogliosis in Parkinson's brain with astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl: New insights from a multi-marker postmortem study.,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant astrocytic involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD), the knowledge regarding the role of reactive astrogliosis is still at the surface level; largely due to lack of specific biomarkers to track these processes. Novel astroglial PET-tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl, hold immense potential for visualizing reactive astrogliosis in PD.  However, they have not been thoroughly investigated in PD. METHODS: We employed a multi-marker approach and performed in vitro radioligand binding and autoradiography studies with (3)H-BU99008 and (3)H-Deprenyl together with astrocytic immunofluorescence and morphometric analyses in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, caudate and putamen brain regions of PD (n = 4) and control (n = 7) cases. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: (3)H-BU99008 and (3)H-Deprenyl showed distinct binding behavior and displayed a diverse array of binding sites (single or multiple) in PD and control brains. Importantly, (3)H-BU99008 and (3)H-Deprenyl autoradiography studies captured pronounced reactive astrogliosis in PD brain regions, corroborated by marked changes in astrocytic markers, morphology, and cellular processes. HIGHLIGHTS: Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl displayed a range of binding sites with different levels of affinity and proportions (%) in healthy control (CN) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brains. Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl showed a highly specific (permanent) high-affinity (HA) binding site in the nanomolar range, which might be consistent across different pathologies. Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl highlighted distinct tracer binding behavior, indicating that they might be targeting different subpopulations or specific states of astrocytes in CN and PD brains. Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl captured prominent reactive astrogliosis at the advanced/end stages of PD, substantiated by a significant increase in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)-positive reactive astrocytes and marked changes in astrocytic morphology and processes.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39755674,Neuropathology-based approach reveals novel Alzheimer's Disease genes and highlights female-specific pathways and causal links to disrupted lipid metabolism: insights into a vicious cycle.,"Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.",Acta neuropathologica communications
39733506,Complete blood count and systemic inflammation indices in individuals with Alzheimer's disease: A case-control study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive and functional decline and is associated with aging. Chronic inflammatory processes are also involved in its the etiology, as the consequence or cause of proteinopathy (amyloid and tau load in the brain). This study aimed to investigate the complete blood count and systemic inflammation indices in 61 individuals with AD, compared to 59 cognitively healthy individuals as controls. The diagnosis of AD dementia was based on the NIA-AA criteria and patients presented biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid compatible with the diagnosis of AD. The complete blood count (CBC) was conducted using an automated system. The neutrophil count (p = 0.011), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.023), and Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI) (p = 0.044) were significantly higher, whereas the lymphocyte count (p = 0.018) and platelet count (p = 0.038) were significantly lower in the AD group compared to the control group. After a multivariategeneralized linear model analyses, neutrophils count and SIRI maintained significant difference between the groups, even after correcting for age, sex, body mass index and ApoE ε4 carrier status. The overall results suggest that AD is associated with a low-grade pro-inflammatory profile, characterized by alterations in blood inflammatory and immune cells, leading to a higher systemic inflammatory index. The CBC and its derived inflammatory indices, routinely obtained in clinical practice, have potential utility in the context of AD.",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society
39812719,Association of IL6 Gene Polymorphisms and Neurological Disorders: Insights from Integrated Bioinformatics and Meta-Analysis.,"Interleukin 6 (IL6) is an inflammatory biomarker linked to central and peripheral nervous system diseases. This study combined bioinformatics and statistical meta-analysis to explore potential associations between IL6 gene variants (rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797) and neurological disorders (NDs) and brain cancer. The meta-analysis was conducted on substantial case-control datasets and revealed a significant correlation between IL6 SNPs (rs1800795 and rs1800796) with overall NDs (p-value < 0.05). The disease-stratified analysis of rs1800795 revealed significant correlations with Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases (p-value < 0.05), while rs1800796 showed a substantial connection with Celiac disease (p-value < 0.05). The ethnicity-stratified analysis revealed noteworthy associations between rs1800795 in both Asians and Caucasians (p-value < 0.05), while rs1800796 showed significant associations across all ethnic groups analyzed (p-value < 0.05). Furthermore, integrated Bioinformatics analyses using GTEx and TCGA datasets highlighted IL6's involvement in NDs and its potential role in brain cancer. Specifically, IL6 SNPs (rs1800795 and rs1800797) showed a significant association with Glioma (p-value < 0.001). Copy number alterations and increased IL6 expressions were linked to cancer severity (p-value < 0.001) and hypoxia (p-value < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that elevated IL6 expression was strongly associated with decreased overall survival in brain cancer patients (p-value < 0.0001).

39800453,Key considerations for combination therapy in Alzheimer's clinical trials: Perspectives from an expert advisory board convened by the Alzheimer's drug discovery foundation.,"There is growing consensus in the Alzheimer's community that combination therapy will be needed to maximize therapeutic benefits through the course of the disease. However, combination therapy raises complex questions and decisions for study sponsors, from preclinical research through clinical trial design to regulatory, statistical, and operational considerations. In January 2024, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation convened an expert advisory board to discuss the key considerations in each of these areas. Experts agreed on the need to prioritize a combination therapy approach that encompasses a wide range of targets associated with aging and the underlying biology of Alzheimer's disease. Progress in combination therapy could be accelerated by leveraging preclinical research and Phase 1 and 2A trials to identify the most promising combinations for further development, exploring repurposed agents with available preclinical and clinical data, building collaborations across sectors to support operational challenges, and planning for the likely impact of anti-amyloid beta-protein monoclonal antibody therapies on future clinical trial designs.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39555916,Spontaneous cerebrovascular reactivity at rest in older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment and memory deficits.,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibit deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), suggesting CVR is a biomarker for vascular contributions to MCI. This study examined if spontaneous CVR is associated with MCI and memory impairment. METHODS: One hundred sixty-one older adults free of dementia or major neurological/psychiatric disorders were recruited. Participants underwent clinical interviews, cognitive testing, venipuncture for Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Spontaneous CVR was quantified during 5 minutes of rest. Respiratory gases analyzed through nasal cannula to quantify end-tidal carbon dioxide ((ET)CO(2)) levels were used to estimate CVR. RESULTS: Whole brain CVR was negatively associated with age, but not MCI. Lower CVR in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) was found in participants with MCI and was linked to worse memory performance on memory tests. Results remained significant after adjusting for AD biomarkers and vascular risk factors. DISCUSSION: Spontaneous CVR deficits in the PHG are observed in older adults with MCI and memory impairment, suggesting medial temporal microvascular dysfunction is observed in cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Aging is associated with decline in whole brain spontaneous cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). Older adults with mild cognitive impairment exhibit deficits in spontaneous CVR in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Memory impairment is correlated with reduced spontaneous CVR in the PHG.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39772842,Perceptions about preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarker collection procedure influences willingness to participate: Findings from an ethnoracially diverse study.,"BACKGROUND: Past research suggests that ethnoracialized groups differ in their willingness to engage in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) research overall. Studies indicated that participation willingness was affected by attitudes toward research and perceived invasiveness of biomarker collection techniques. However, comparative quantitative studies are few, and minoritized groups are under-included. OBJECTIVE: In a cross-sectional online survey, we sought to explore community-based adults' willingness to engage in preclinical AD biomarker testing, comparing their attitudes about research and different types of biomarker procedures. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a diverse group of participants. African American (AA), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Latinx (LTX), and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults aged 26-90 were asked about their research attitudes, biomarkers, and willingness to participate in specific biomarker test procedures (i.e., brain imaging via PET scanning, blood draws, and cerebrospinal fluid collection by lumbar puncture). We also assessed participants' perceived safety, burden, and distress for each of the three biomarker collection methods. To understand the association between research willingness and ethnoracial identity, we ran linear regression models for each procedure, adjusting for age, gender, educational attainment, and attitudes toward research. RESULTS: The AA group expressed greater willingness to engage in biomarker testing involving blood draws than the NHW group. The AI/AN group was significantly less willing to undergo lumbar puncture than the NHW group; this difference remained after adjusting for various sociodemographic factors and research attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents' willingness to engage in preclinical AD biomarker research was affected by their perceptions about the testing collection procedure.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
40017276,Association of Rapidly Elevated Plasma Tau Protein With Cognitive Decline in Patients With Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Whether elevation in plasma levels of amyloid and tau protein biomarkers are better indicators of cognitive decline than higher baseline levels in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains understudied. METHODS: We included 67 participants with twice testing for AD-related plasma biomarkers via immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays (amyloid beta [Aβ]1-40, Aβ1-42, total tau [t-Tau], phosphorylated tau [p-Tau] 181, and alpha-synuclein [α-Syn]) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) over a 1-year interval. We examined the correlation between biomarker levels (baseline vs. longitudinal change) and annual changes in the MMSE scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to compare the biomarkers. RESULTS: After adjustment, faster cognitive decline was correlated with lower baseline levels of t-Tau (β=0.332, p=0.030) and p-Tau 181 (β=0.369, p=0.015) and rapid elevation of t-Tau (β=-0.330, p=0.030) and p-Tau 181 levels (β=-0.431, p=0.004). However, the levels (baseline and longitudinal changes) of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and α-Syn were not correlated with cognitive decline. aMCI converters had lower baseline levels of p-Tau 181 (p=0.002) but larger annual changes (p=0.001) than aMCI non-converters. The change in p-Tau 181 levels showed better discriminatory capacity than the change in t-Tau levels in terms of identifying AD conversion in patients with aMCI, with an area under curve of 86.7% versus 72.2%. CONCLUSION: We found changes in p-Tau 181 levels may be a suitable biomarker for identifying AD conversion.",Psychiatry investigation
39815268,Association between domain-specific physical activity and triglyceride‑glucose (TyG) index among US adults: Evidence from NHANES 2007-2018.,"OBJECTIVES: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is not only a reliable marker for insulin resistance, but also has broad applications in assessing the risk of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to investigate the relationship between domain-specific moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and TyG index among US adults. METHODS: The participants from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2007-2018) were included. Different PA domains, including occupation-related MVPA (O-MVPA), transportation-related MVPA (T-MVPA), and leisure-time MVPA (LT-MVPA), were assessed by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Weighted multivariable linear regression and the propensity score matching (PSM) method were used to determine the relationship between domain-specific MVPA and TyG index. Furthermore, stratified and mediation analyses were employed to assess the potential effect modifications and mediators on the association. RESULTS: A total of 12,069 participants were included. The participants had a weighted mean age of 47.43 ± 16.91 years and a weighted mean TyG index of 8.58 ± 0.67. Weighted multivariable linear regression showed that leisure-time MVPA (LT-MVPA), whether at any amount or achieving physical activity guidelines, was negatively associated with TyG index (β = -0.10, 95%CI: -0.13- -0.07, P < 0.001, and β = -0.13, 95%CI: -0.17- -0.10, P < 0.001, respectively). O-MVPA and T-MVPA were not correlated with the TyG index, even at the recommended amount (β = 0.01, 95%CI: -0.02-0.03, P = 0.59 for O-MVPA, and β = -0.02, 95%CI: -0.07-0.02, P = 0.32 for T-MVPA). After PSM, the results were still robust. Furthermore, the stratified analysis found that the correlation between LT-MVPA and TyG index was stronger in females, those with higher family incomes, and non-smokers. Finally, mediation analyses indicated a significant joint mediation effect of BMI on the relationships between LT-MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) and the TyG index, accounting for 31.48% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: LT-MVPA was associated with a decreased TyG index in US adults, while no such association was observed with O-MVPA or T-MVPA.

Visualizing the two processes is paramount to advance our understanding of AD pathologies. Among the biomarkers identified, peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) emerges as a key molecule in the initiation and aggravation of ER stress and ER-phagy, highlighting its significance in the underlying mechanisms of the two processes. In this work, we designed and synthesized an innovative ONOO(-)-responsive AIEgen-based fluorescent probe (DHQM) with the ability to monitor ER stress and ER-phagy in AD model cells. DHQM demonstrated excellent aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties, endowing it with outstanding ability for washing-free intracellular imaging. Meanwhile, it exhibited high sensitivity, remarkable selectivity to ONOO(-), and exceptional ER-targeting ability. The probe was successfully applied for fluorescence imaging of ER ONOO(-) fluctuations to assess the ER stress status in aluminum-induced AD model cells. Our findings revealed that aluminum-induced ferroptosis, a regulated cell death process, was pivotal in the excessive ONOO(-) production, which in turn activated and exacerbated ER stress. Furthermore, the aluminum-stimulated ER-phagy was observed utilizing DHQM, which might be crucial in inhibiting ferroptosis and mitigating aberrant ER stress. Overall, this study not only offers valuable insights into the pathological mechanisms of AD at the ER level but also opens new potential therapeutic avenues targeting these pathways.",ACS chemical neuroscience
39255904,Associations between differential connectivity patterns of executive control networks and APOE ɛ4 in the Alzheimer continuum.,"The APOE ɛ4 allele and age are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to decreased executive function. However, the influence of APOE ɛ4 on the executive control network (ECN) in the AD continuum is still unclear. This study included 269 participants aged between 50 and 95 years old, based on ADNI data, including 104 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 72 individuals with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 55 individuals with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 38 AD patients. Within each disease group, participants were subdivided into APOE ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. We explored brain regions within the ECN affected by the interactions between genes and disease states by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and voxel-based two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Subsequently, functional connectivity (FC) between seeds and peak clusters were extracted and correlated with the cognitive performance. We found that the damages of carrying APOE ɛ4 in ECNs mainly distributed in the fronto-parietal and parietal-temporal systems. Functional network intergroup differences indicated increased intrafrontal and fronto-parietal connectivity at the early stage of AD and increased connectivity between the parietal lobe and related regions at late disease in these APOE ɛ4 carriers. Our conclusion is that the functional connectivity in the ECN exhibits different distinguishably patterns of impairment in the AD continuum under the influence of the APOE ɛ4 allele. Patients with different genotypes showed heterogeneity in functional network changes in the early stages of disease, which may be a potential biomarker for early AD.",Brain research
39236569,An activatable near-infrared fluorescent probe with large Stokes shift for visualizing peroxynitrite in Alzheimer's disease models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by its incurable nature and prevalence among the elderly, has remained a focal point in medical research. Increasing evidence suggests that peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) serves as a crucial biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. In this study, we present a novel, easily available, high-yield, and cost-effective near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, CDCI-ONOO. This probe utilizes a coumarin-dicyanoisophorone conjugate as the fluorophore and diphenylphosphinic chloride as the recognition site, enabling the detection of ONOO(-) both in vitro and in vivo. Upon interaction with ONOO(-), CDCI-ONOO exhibits a distinct maximum emission peak at 715 nm with a substantial Stokes shift of 184 nm. The probe demonstrates excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 144 nM), along with noticeable colorimetric and fluorescence changes after the reaction. Comprehensive analyses using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the reaction with ONOO(-) restores the initially quenched Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT), resulting in the formation of CDCI-OH, a product that emitting fluorescence in the near-infrared region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the successful application of CDCI-ONOO for ONOO(-) detection in neuronal cells and imaging of ONOO(-) in the brains of mice. These findings underscore the potential of CDCI-ONOO as a near-infrared fluorescent probe for in vivo ONOO(-) detection, offering a significant avenue for advancing our understanding of AD pathology and diagnosis.","Spectrochimica acta.

39639569,Articulatory precision from connected speech as a marker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease risk-enriched cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been recognized as a possible precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent research focusing on connected speech has uncovered various features strongly correlated with MCI due to AD and related dementias. Despite these advancements, the impact of early cognitive decline on articulatory precision has not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study introduced the phoneme log-likelihood ratio (PLLR) to assess the articulatory precision of speakers across different cognitive status levels and compared its effectiveness to existing well-studied acoustic features. METHODS: The study utilized speech recordings from a picture description task, which included data from 324 cognitively unimpaired participants with low amyloid-β burden (CU, Aβ( - )), 47 cognitively unimpaired participants with high amyloid-β burden (CU, Aβ( + )), 69 participants with MCI, and 20 participants with dementia. Nine acoustic features were extracted from the speech recordings, covering three categories: speech fluency, speech pace, and articulatory precision. Welch's t-test and Hedge's g were adopted to assess their discriminative ability. RESULTS: A reduction in speech fluency and pace was observed among participants in the MCI and dementia groups. The PLLR shows large effect sizes in distinguishing between cognitively unimpaired participants with low Aβ burden and those diagnosed with MCI or dementia. Additionally, the test-retest reliability experiment indicated moderate repeatability of the features under study. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals PLLR as a sensitive indicator capable of detecting subtle articulatory variations across groups, while also providing further support for the association between reduced articulatory precision and early cognitive decline.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39812240,Establishing Decisional Cutoff Values of Neurofilament Light Chains in Cerebrospinal Fluid Measured by Fully Automated Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is one of the most important biomarkers in the field of clinical neurochemistry. Several analytical methods have been developed in the last decade. Recently, Fujirebio introduced a ready-to-use assay kit for measuring NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the fully automated LUMIPULSE G System. In this study, we established the decisional cutoffs for CSF NfL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients with cognitive decline. CSF NfL levels were measured by two analytical methods: the NF-light ELISA kit (UmanDiagnostics) and the Lumipulse G1200 fully automated system (Fujirebio). We calculated the cutoffs for the Lumipulse, starting from the consolidated cutoffs of the ELISA method for each age and using the equation obtained by the regression analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 100 patients with cognitive decline. The median levels of CSF NfL measured by Lumipulse and ELISA were 776.5 ± 772.6 pg/mL and 473.5 ± 443.5 pg/mL, respectively, significantly different (p < 0.001). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.962, indicating a robust positive correlation between the two measurement methods. The equation derived from the Passing-Bablok regression analysis was CSF CLEIA = -61.16 + 1.83 × CSF ELISA. Based on this equation, we defined the decisional cutoff values. CONCLUSIONS: Decisional cutoffs are fundamental tools for guiding clinicians to use biomarkers' results and interpretation appropriately. This is the first study establishing the decisional cutoff value of NfL measured by Lumipulse, a fully automated platform widely used in clinical laboratories.",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis
39865687,Digital detector PET/CT increases Centiloid measures of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease: A head-to-head comparison of cameras.,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease has led to increased interest in precisely quantifying amyloid-β (Aβ) burden for diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and further clinical research. Recent positron emission tomography (PET) hardware innovations including digital detectors have led to superior resolution and sensitivity, improving quantitative accuracy. However, the effect of PET scanner on Centiloid remains relatively unexplored and is assumed to be minimized by harmonizing PET resolutions. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the differences in Centiloid between scanners in a paired cohort. METHODS: 36 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle study (AIBL) cohort were scanned within a year on two scanners. Each participant underwent (18)F-NAV4694 imaging on two of the three scanners investigated, the Siemens Vision, the Siemens mCT and the Philips Gemini. We compared Aβ Centiloid quantification between scanners and assessed the effectiveness of post-reconstruction PET resolution harmonization. We further compared the scanner differences in target sub-regions and with different reference regions to assess spatial variability. RESULTS: Centiloid from the Vision camera was found to be significantly higher compared to the Gemini and mCT; the difference was greater at high-Centiloid levels. Post-reconstruction resolution harmonization only accounted for and corrected ∼20% of the Centiloid (CL) difference between scanners. We further demonstrated that residual differences have effects that vary spatially between different subregions of the Centiloid mask. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the type of PET scanner that a participant is scanned on affects Centiloid quantification, even when scanner resolution is harmonized. We conclude by highlighting the need for further investigation into harmonization techniques that consider scanner differences.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39988989,Disclosure of elevated amyloid status is not associated with long-term suicidality in a preclinical AD trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The long-term implications of disclosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired individuals are unknown. METHODS: We compared participants who disclosed their elevated amyloid imaging result in a preclinical AD trial to those who disclosed a not elevated result and enrolled in an observational cohort that underwent parallel assessments. Our primary outcome was a score > 0 on the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at any visit; we also considered suicidal behaviors (CSSRS > 5). RESULTS: Among 1707 total participants (68% elevated amyloid, mean [standard deviation] age 71.5 [4.7], 60% female, 90% non-Hispanic White), followed for a mean 218 (74.1) weeks, there were no suicides and few indications of suicidal thoughts (n = 124 [7%]) or behaviors (n = 13 [<1%]). In a generalized estimating equation model controlling for covariates, we observed no effect of amyloid status on the primary outcome of CSSRS > 0 (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 0.76, 3.37). DISCUSSION: With a structured approach, brain amyloid results can be returned safely. HIGHLIGHTS: The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study was among the first and largest studies to include biomarker disclosure in a population without cognitive impairment. Routine psychological assessment provided a novel assessment of the impact of disclosure in this sample. Learning an elevated brain amyloid result through a protocolized approach was not associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors compared to a matched cohort who learned they did not have elevated brain amyloid. Future research will be needed to ensure similar safety in more real-world settings.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39775804,Development and Validation of a Tool to Predict Onset of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Dementia.,"IMPORTANCE: The ability to predict the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer dementia (AD) could allow older adults and clinicians to make informed decisions about dementia care. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the age at onset of MCI and AD can be predicted using a statistical modeling approach. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used data from 2 aging and dementia cohort studies-the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-for model development and validation of the Florey Dementia Index (FDI), a tool used to predict the age at onset of MCI and AD in older adults. Data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer (A4) study were used for a simulated trial. Data were collected from 1665 AIBL participants, 2029 ADNI participants, and 93 A4 participants from October 1, 2004, to March 1, 2023. The data analysis was conducted between January and August 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predicted age at onset compared with clinically observed age at onset. RESULTS: Among the 1665 AIBL participants (741 [44.5%] female) and 2029 ADNI participants (925 [45.6%] female), the mean (SD) age at first evaluation was 71.8 (7.1) years and 74.5 (6.7) years, respectively. The FDI achieved mean absolute errors of 2.78 (95% CI, 2.63-2.93) years for predicting MCI onset and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.32-1.65) years for predicting AD onset. In the simulated trial with 93 A4 participants (48 [51.6%] female; mean [SD] age at baseline, 73.4 [5.1] years), the FDI achieved mean absolute errors of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.41-1.71) years for predicting MCI onset and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.88) years for predicting AD onset. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, the FDI was developed and validated to predict the onset age of MCI and AD. This tool may be useful in organizing health care for older adults with cognitive decline or dementia and in the future may help prioritize patients for the use of disease-modifying monoclonal antibody drugs.",JAMA network open
39317176,Differential Item Functioning and Clinical Utility of the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire in a Multi-Ethnic Cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ) in a non-Hispanic White (NHW) and Mexican American (MA) sample from Texas in the USA. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Health and Aging Brain Study - Health Disparities (HABS-HD; N = 1,691, age = 66.5 ± 8.7, education = 12.4 ± 4.8, 60.6% female, 33.2% MA Spanish speaking). Unidimensionality of the SMCQ was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. Differential item functioning (DIF) of the SMCQ was assessed across age, sex, education, and ethnicity/language using item response theory/logistic ordinal regression. Associations of the SMCQ in relation to cognitive status, Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers, and psychological distress were examined. RESULTS: The SMCQ showed excellent fit in a single-factor model (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA [95% CI] = 0.05 [0.04, 0.05], SRMR = 0.07). Significant item-level DIF was detected by education level and ethnicity/language, but not by age or sex; when detected, DIF was not salient (i.e., adverse). The SMCQ was associated with greater psychological distress, worse Clinical Dementia Rating scores, and greater disease burden as measured by total tau and neurofilament light. CONCLUSIONS: Practically negligible item-level bias was identified across education and ethnicity/language. Detected DIF can be described as benign, indicating that some items manifested differently between groups but had minimal impact on measurement properties. These results demonstrate that the SMCQ performs appropriately across demographic variables. Our findings also provide support for the associations of SMCQ scores with self-reported mood, cognitive status, and AD blood-based biomarkers.",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders
38824476,"Associations of tau, Aβ, and brain volume of the Papez circuit with cognition in Alzheimer's disease.","This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional associations between regional Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including tau, β-amyloid (Aβ), and brain volume, within the Papez circuit, and neuropsychological functioning across the preclinical and clinical spectrum of AD. We utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 251 Aβ-positive participants. Participants were categorized into three groups based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR): 73 individuals with preclinical AD (CDR = 0), 114 with prodromal AD (CDR = 0.5), and 64 with clinical AD dementia (CDR ≥ 1). Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, gender, and education years, were employed to evaluate the associations between five regions of interest (the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus) and five neuropsychological tests across the three imaging modalities. In the preclinical stage of AD, flortaucipir PET was associated with impaired global cognition and episodic memory (range standardized β = 0.255-0.498, p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons), while florbetapir PET and brain volume were marginally related to global cognition (range standardized β = 0.221-0.231, p < 0.05). In the clinical stages of AD (prodromal and dementia), both increased flortaucipir uptake and decreased brain volume were significantly associated with poorer global neuropsychological and episodic memory performance (range standardized β = 0.222-0.621, p < 0.05, most regions of interest survived correction for multiple comparisions). However, a slight relationship was observed between florbetapir uptake and poorer global cognitive function. The regions most affected by flortaucipir PET were the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. During the clinical stages, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibited the most significant volumetric changes. Tau PET and brain volume measurements within the Papez circuit are more sensitive indicators of early cognitive deficits in AD than Aβ PET. Furthermore, during the clinical stages of AD, both flortaucipir PET and brain volume of the Papez circuit are closely correlated with cognitive decline. These findings underscore the importance of integrating multiple biomarkers for the comprehensive evaluation of AD pathology and its impact on cognition.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience
39762947,"Depressive symptoms in older adults are associated with changes in stress-related markers, functional connectivity and brain volume.","BACKGROUND: Subclinical depressive symptoms increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this link may involve stress system dysfunction, notably related to the hippocampus which is particularly sensitive to AD. We aimed to investigate the links between blood stress markers and changes in brain regions involved in the stress response in older adults with or without subclinical depressive symptoms. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using baseline data from the Age-Well trial. Cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with (DepS; n = 73) or without (NoDepS; n = 58) subclinical depressive symptoms (defined using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) were included in the analyses. Blood cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured; as well as the resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) between, and gray matter (GM) volume of, the hypothalamus, hippocampus and hippocampal subfields. Blood stress markers levels and neuroimaging measures were compared between groups; then regression analyses were conducted between these measures. RESULTS: DepS participants showed higher plasma epinephrine levels, which was associated with greater rs-FC between the CA1 and Subiculum hippocampal subfields and the hypothalamus. Lower GM volume in the CA1 and DG/CA2-3-4 subfields was also found in DepS. No between-group differences were observed for blood cortisol and norepinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that subclinical depressive symptoms are associated with increased sympatho-adrenomedullary axis activity, together with lower GM volume in a hippocampal subfield (i.e., CA1) particularly sensitive to AD. While causation cannot be inferred, these results suggest that screening and treating subclinical depressive symptoms in CU older adults could reduce AD risk.

39799781,Delayed primacy recall in AVLT is associated with medial temporal tau PET burden in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be diagnosed by in vivo abnormalities of amyloid-β plaques (A) and tau accumulation (T) biomarkers. Previous studies have shown that analyses of serial position performance in episodic memory tests, and especially, delayed primacy, are associated with AD pathology even in individuals who are cognitively unimpaired. The earliest signs of cortical tau pathology are observed in medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions, yet it is unknown if serial position markers are also associated with early tau load in these regions. This study of cognitively unimpaired older individuals examined whether serial position scores in word-list recall cross-sectionally predicted tau PET load in the MTL, and were able to discriminate between biomarker profiles, based on AT classification. METHODS: Data from 490 participants (mean age = 68.8 ± 7.2) were extracted from two cohorts, which were merged into one sample. Linear regression analyses were carried out with regional volume-controlled tau (18F-MK-6240) PET SUVR of the entorhinal cortex (EC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and hippocampus (H) as outcomes, cross-sectional memory scores from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test as predictors (total and delayed recall, along with serial position scores) and control variables, in separate analyses for each outcome and predictor. The sample was then stratified by biomarker profile and ANCOVAs were conducted with the strongest scores from the regression analyses, AT groups as fixed factor and the covariates. RESULTS: Higher delayed primacy significantly predicted lower tau PET in EC, PHC, and H, cross-sectionally. Higher total recall scores predicted lower EC tau, but delayed primacy showed the best model fit, as indicated by AICs. ANCOVAs showed that AVLT metrics did not significantly discriminate between A-T- and A+T+, after correcting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Serial position analysis of word-list recall, particularly delayed primacy, may be a valuable tool for identifying in vivo tau pathology in cognitively unimpaired individuals.",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior
39963471,Ketamine does not rescue plaque load or gap detection in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Ketamine has received growing attention for its effects on neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation, and as a treatment for depression and other mental health disorders. Recent evidence suggests that early sensory and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease could be caused by synaptic disruption that occurs before irreversible neuropathology. This raises the possibility that ketamine could slow down or prevent network disruption and the ensuing sensory and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's. Here we tested this idea in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's, using either an acute single injection of ketamine, or chronic daily injections over 15 weeks. We tested the effects of ketamine on both amyloid plaque load and on a behavioral auditory gap detection task that is an early Alzheimer's biomarker in both mice and humans. We found that ketamine had no effect on plaque load, nor any effect on gap detection, for either acute or chronic dosing. Chronic ketamine facilitated startle responses specifically in 5XFAD mice, but this could simply be related to experience-dependent effects on stress or habituation rather than any rescue effect of ketamine on Alzheimer's-related deficits. We did find robust correlations between gap detection deficits and plaque load in auditory cortex and in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus, demonstrating that the behavioral deficits seen in 5XFAD mice are directly related to amyloid accumulation in these brain regions, and confirming the validity of gap detection as an early biomarker of Alzheimer's. Ketamine, however, had no effect on the strength of these correlations. We conclude that ketamine has no beneficial effect on the development of behavioral gap detection deficits or plaque load in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's mouse model, following either an acute single dose or a chronic daily dose regimen.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39946634,"p-Tau/Aβ42 ratio associates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively unimpaired older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Among the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based measures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, the ratiometric measure of p-tau/Aβ42 shows the best diagnostic accuracy. However, few studies have linked the p-tau/Aβ42 ratio to cognition directly. The goal of this study was to examine whether a CSF-based p-tau/Aβ42 ratio predicts changes in global cognitive functioning, episodic memory, and executive functioning over a 2-year period in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults, in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and in those with AD. METHOD: This study involves secondary analysis of data from 1,215 older adults available in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Neuropsychological composite variables, collected at baseline, 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-ups, of global cognition, episodic memory, and executive functioning, were included. Generalized least square linear models were constructed to examine the effect of CSF p-tau/Aβ42, diagnostic group, and change over time on cognitive scores. RESULTS: CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio predicted cognitive decline, both on global cognition and episodic memory, in individuals with MCI and AD, but not in CU older adults. The p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, in contrast, predicted decline in executive functioning for all three diagnostic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, which included individuals with CU, MCI, and AD, provides evidence of differential cognitive consequences of accumulated AD pathology across diagnostic groups, particularly in the domains of global cognition and episodic memory. Additionally, AD pathology was associated with worsening executive functioning across all three diagnostic groups, suggesting that declines in executive functioning may occur well before declines in other cognitive domains.

39811969,Tungsten disulphide nanosheet modulated fluorescent gold nanocluster immunoprobe for the detection of tau peptide: Alzheimer's disease biomarker.,"The neuronal tau peptide serves as a key biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, specifically, Alzheimer's disease, a condition that currently has no cure or definitive diagnosis. The methodology to noninvasively detect tau levels from body fluids remains a major hurdle for a rapid and simple diagnostic approach. Thus, developing new detection methods for sensing tau protein levels is crucial. In this work, we report an immunoprobe based on anti-tau antibody (mAb-tau)-conjugated fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) quenched with tungsten disulphide nanosheets (WS(2) NS) for the detection of tau protein in human serum samples. The mAb-tau conjugated probe is designed to provide a specific binding site for the tau peptide by strong antigen-antibody interface. The WS(2) NS surface quenches the fluorescence of mAb-tau@AuNCs, which is subsequently recovered by the addition of tau peptide in a linear concentration range (63.3-615.38 pg mL(-1)). The enhancement in fluorescence of WS(2) NS@mAb-tau@AuNCs enables the quantification of tau peptide in concentrations pertinent to human serum tau levels in Alzheimer's patients. The developed probe achieves a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 6.54 pg mL(-1) and 21.8 pg mL(-1) for tau peptide in PBS buffer. The study is further extended in spiked human serum samples, with satisfactory recovery percentages in the range of 94.37-117.53%. The technique holds promise as an immunoprobe for tau peptide detection and has potential in developing an economically viable probe for the clinical diagnosis of tau-related neurodegenerative disorders.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications
39603147,Nitroxidative stress in human neural progenitor cells: In situ measurement of nitric oxide/peroxynitrite imbalance using metalloporphyrin nanosensors.,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential inorganic signaling molecule produced by constitutive NO synthase (cNOS) in the neurological system. Under pathological conditions, NO rapidly reacts with superoxide (O(2)(•-)) to generate peroxynitrite (ONOO(¯)). Elevated ONOO(¯) concentrations induce nitroxidative stress, potentially contributing to numerous pathological processes as observed in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metalloporphyrin nanosensors, (200-300 nm diameter), were applied to quantify the NO/ONOO(¯) balance produced by a single human neural progenitor cell (hNPC), in situ. These nanosensors, positioned in proximity of 4-5 ± 1 μm from the hNPCs membrane, enabled real-time measurement of NO and ONOO(¯) concentrations following calcium ionophore (CaI) stimulation. The ratio of NO to ONOO(¯) concentration ([NO]/[ONOO(¯)]) was established for the purpose of quantifying nitroxidative stress levels. Normal hNPCs produced a maximum of 107 ± 1 nmol/L of NO and 451 ± 7 nmol/L of ONOO(¯), yielding a [NO]/[ONOO(¯)] ratio of 0.25 ± 0.005. In contrast, the model of the dysfunctional hNPCs, for long-term (48 h) amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ(42)) exposure significantly altered NO/ONOO(¯) production. The NO level decreased to 14 ± 0.1 nmol/L, while ONOO(¯) increased to 843 ± 0.8 nmol/L, resulting in a 94 % reduction of the [NO]/[ONOO(¯)] ratio to 0.016 ± 0.0001. The [NO]/[ONOO(¯)] ratio is determined by this work as a possible biomarker of nNOS efficiency and hNPC dysfunction, with implications for neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Promising applications in the early medical diagnosis of neurological illnesses, electrochemical metalloporphyrin nanosensors demonstrate efficacy in real-time nitroxidative stress monitoring.",Journal of inorganic biochemistry
38757180,Neurofilament Light Chain as a Biomarker of Global Cognition in Individuals With Possible Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) is a biomarker of axonal injury elevated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease dementia. Blood NfL also inversely correlates with cognitive performance in those conditions. However, few studies have assessed NfL as a biomarker of global cognition in individuals demonstrating mild cognitive deficits who are at risk for vascular-related cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between blood NfL and global cognition in individuals with possible vascular MCI (vMCI) throughout cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Additionally, NfL levels were compared to age/sex-matched cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. METHOD: Participants with coronary artery disease (vMCI or CU) were recruited at entry to a 24-week CR program. Global cognition was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and plasma NfL level (pg/ml) was quantified using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Higher plasma NfL was correlated with worse MoCA scores at baseline (β = -.352, P = .029) in 43 individuals with vMCI after adjusting for age, sex, and education. An increase in NfL was associated with worse global cognition (b[SE] = -4.81[2.06], P = .023) over time, however baseline NfL did not predict a decline in global cognition. NfL levels did not differ between the vMCI (n = 39) and CU (n = 39) groups (F(1, 76) = 1.37, P = .245). CONCLUSION: Plasma NfL correlates with global cognition at baseline in individuals with vMCI, and is associated with decline in global cognition during CR. Our findings increase understanding of NfL and neurobiological mechanisms associated with cognitive decline in vMCI.",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology
39808341,The CD74 inhibitor DRhQ improves short-term memory and mitochondrial function in 5xFAD mouse model of Aβ accumulation.,"Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are early events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests that the inflammatory axis mediated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) binding to its receptor, CD74, plays an important role in many central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as AD. Our group has developed DRhQ, a novel CD74 binding construct which competitively inhibits MIF binding, blocks macrophage activation and migration into the CNS, enhances anti-inflammatory microglia cell numbers and reduces pro-inflammatory gene expression. Here, we evaluate its effects in amyloid-β (Aβ) overexpressing mice. 5xFAD mice and their wild type littermates were treated with DRhQ (100 µg) or vehicle for 4 weeks. DRhQ improved cognition and cortical mitochondrial function in both male and female 5xFAD mice. Aβ plaque burden in 5xFAD animals was not robustly impacted by DRhQ treatment in either the hippocampus or the cortex. Cortical microglial activation was similarly not apparently affected by DRhQ treatment, although in the hippocampus there was evidence of a reduction in activated microglia for female 5xFAD mice. Future studies are needed to confirm this possible sex-dependent response on microglial activation, as well as to optimize the dose and timing of DRhQ treatment and gain a better understanding of its mechanism of action in AD.",Metabolic brain disease
39921301,Hippocampal Subfield Volume in Relation to Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-ß in Early Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnostic Utility of 7T MRI.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by amyloid plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles. Early detection is essential for effective intervention, but current diagnostic methods that enable early diagnosis in clinical practice rely on invasive or costly biomarker scanning. This study aimed to explore the utility of 7T MRI in assessing hippocampal subfield volumes and their correlation with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in prodromal AD. METHODS: Fifty-six participants, including AD patients and healthy controls, underwent 7T MRI scanning. Automated segmentation delineated hippocampal subfield volumes, with subsequent normalisation to whole brain volume. RESULTS: Significant differences in hippocampal and subfield volumes were observed in prodromal AD patients, even when they did not exhibit high MTA scores on 3T MRI or show any whole brain volume loss. Additionally, the volume of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) correlated significantly with CSF amyloid-β levels, suggesting ERC's potential as a proxy CSF amyloid-ß measurement. Conversely, no significant associations were found between CSF 181-Phosphorylated-tau or total tau levels and any hippocampal subfield volumes. DISCUSSION: These findings show the potential use of 7T MRI, particularly in ERC assessment, as a biomarker for early AD identification. Further validation studies are warranted to confirm these results and elucidate the relationship of ERC volume with CSF biomarkers.",European journal of neurology
38622351,The potential molecular markers of inflammatory response in KOA with AD based on single-cell transcriptome sequencing analysis and identification of ligands by virtual screening.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoarthritis (OA) are both senile degenerative diseases. Clinical studies have found that OA patients have a significantly increased risk of AD in their later life. This study hypothesized that chronic aseptic inflammation might lead to AD in KOA patients. However, current research has not yet clarified the potential mechanism between AD and KOA. Therefore, this study intends to use KOA transcriptional profiling and single-cell sequencing analysis technology to explore the molecular mechanism of KOA affecting AD development, and screen potential molecular biomarkers and drugs for the prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis of AD in KOA patients. It was found that the higher the expression of TXNIP, MMP3, and MMP13, the higher the risk coefficient of AD was. In addition, the AUC of TXNIP, MMP3, and MMP13 were all greater than 0.70, which had good diagnostic significance for AD. Finally, through the virtual screening of core proteins in FDA drugs and molecular dynamics simulation, it was found that compound Cobicistat could be targeted to TXNIP, Itc could be targeted to MMP3, and Isavuconazonium could be targeted to MMP13. To sum up, TXNIP, MMP3, and MMP13 are prospective molecular markers in KOA with AD, which could be used to predict, diagnose, and prognosis.",Molecular diversity
39791247,Urinary formic acid is associated with cerebral amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism in memory clinic patients.,"BACKGROUND: Urinary formic acid (FA) has been reported to be a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between FA and pathological changes in memory clinic patients is currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate associations between FA and pathological changes across different cognitive statuses in memory clinic patients. METHODS: A cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-Aβ- n = 37, MCI-Aβ+ n = 33), AD dementia (n = 39), and cognitively normal subjects (CN-Aβ- n = 98, CN-Aβ+ n = 50) were included. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, urinary FA, AD-related plasma biomarkers, MRI scans, [(18)F]-flurbetapir and [(18)F]-FDG PET scan data were collected from all participants. RESULTS: Urinary FA levels were higher in patients with MCI and AD than in CN subjects and higher in Aβ+ (CN- Aβ+, MCI-Aβ+, AD dementia) subjects than in Aβ-subjects (CN- Aβ-, MCI-Aβ-). Urinary FA was positively associated with cerebral Aβ deposition and negatively associated with glucose metabolism, both at the global level and in multiple regions of interest cortical regions in participants with different cognitive statuses. Additionally, urinary FA levels were positively correlated with the severity of white matter hyperintensities and hippocampal atrophy. Urinary FA combined with age, Mini-Mental State Examination, plasma p-tau181, and neuroﬁlament light chain could be used to predict Aβ deposition in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary FA is associated with brain pathological changes in memory clinic patients, including cerebral Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, white matter hyperintensities, and hippocampal atrophy. It could be used as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD and predicting Aβ deposition.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39789939,Association of Favorable Cerebrospinal Fluid Markers With Reversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Parkinson's Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a common nonmotor symptom among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although cognitive impairment generally develops progressively, individuals with PD-associated mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) may revert to being cognitively normal (CN), which is referred to as PD-MCI reversion. Previous studies are inconsistent in whether PD-MCI reverters are at greater risk for PD-MCI recurrence relative to CN individuals. Even less is known about how PD-MCI reverters compare with CN individuals or PD-MCI nonreverters in terms of neurodegenerative biomarkers. The authors examined group differences (CN, PD-MCI reversion, and PD-MCI nonreversion) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid beta, tau (total [t-tau] and phosphorylated [p-tau]), and alpha-synuclein. METHODS: Data from the longitudinal international multisite Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative were used. Participants were newly diagnosed as having PD (N=430) and completed a battery of neurocognitive assessments at baseline and annual follow-ups for up to 5 years. Participants were classified as CN, PD-MCI reverters, or PD-MCI nonreverters on the basis of the first two neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: The PD-MCI nonreversion group had greater p-tau:amyloid beta and t-tau:amyloid beta ratios relative to the PD-MCI reversion group. The CN and PD-MCI reversion groups did not significantly differ in any of the CSF markers. CONCLUSIONS: PD-MCI reverters may have a more favorable trajectory in terms of AD pathology relative to PD-MCI nonreverters. Future studies are needed to verify whether PD-MCI reversion may represent an intermediate prognostic group between CN individuals and those with MCI nonreversion.",The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences
39844303,Exploring sex differences in Alzheimer's disease: a comprehensive analysis of a large patient cohort from a memory unit.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the leading cause of dementia worldwide, and projections estimate over 150 million patients by 2050. AD prevalence is notably higher in women, nearly twice that of men, with discernible sex differences in certain risk factors. To enhance our understanding of how sex influences the characteristics of AD patients and its potential impact on the disease trajectory, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of demographic, clinical, cognitive, and genetic data from a sizable and well-characterized cohort of AD dementia patients at a memory clinic in Barcelona, Spain. METHODS: The study cohort comprised individuals with probable and possible AD dementia with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score between 1 and 3 diagnosed at the Memory Unit from Ace Alzheimer Center Barcelona, Spain, between 2008 and 2018. We obtained cognitive baseline data and follow up scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the CDR scale, and the neuropsychological battery used in our center (NBACE). We employed various statistical techniques to assess the impact of sex on cognitive evolution in these dementia patients, accounting for other sex-related risk factors identified through Machine Learning methods. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised a total of 6108 individuals diagnosed with AD dementia during the study period (28.4% males and 71.6% females). MMSE scores exhibited an average decline of approximately two units per year, unaffected by sex. Similarly, the decline in most neuropsychological functions assessed by NBACE did not exhibit significant differences between males and females. However, we observed that women diagnosed with mild AD dementia progressed more rapidly based on their CDR score (HR = 2.57, 95%CI:2.33-2.84) than men (HR = 2.03, 95%CI: 1.71-2.41) (p-interaction = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not strongly support the notion that sex significantly modifies the clinical progression of AD dementia based on cognitive data. Further research is essential to validate whether women with mild AD dementia indeed progress more rapidly than men at a similar stage and to delve into the potential underlying reasons for this finding.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
39774493,Sex differences in mitochondrial free-carnitine levels in subjects at-risk and with Alzheimer's disease in two independent study cohorts.,"A major challenge in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the identification of molecular mechanisms linked to specific pathophysiological features of the disease. Importantly AD has a two-fold higher incidence in women than men and a protracted prodromal phase characterized by amnestic mild-cognitive impairment (aMCI) suggesting that biological processes occurring early can initiate vulnerability to AD. Here, we used a sample of 125 subjects from two independent study cohorts to determine the levels in plasma (the most accessible specimen) of two essential mitochondrial markers acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) and its derivative free-carnitine motivated by a mechanistic model in rodents in which targeting mitochondrial metabolism of LAC leads to the amelioration of cognitive function and boosts epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression. We report a sex-specific deficiency in free-carnitine levels in women with aMCI and early-AD compared to cognitively healthy controls; no change was observed in men. We also replicated the prior finding of decreased LAC levels in both women and men with AD, supporting the robustness of the study samples assayed in our new study. The magnitude of the sex-specific free-carnitine deficiency reflected the severity of cognitive dysfunction and held in two study cohorts. Furthermore, patients with the lower free-carnitine levels showed higher β-amyloid(Aβ) accumulation and t-Tau levels assayed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Computational analyses showed that the mitochondrial markers assayed in plasma are at least as accurate as CSF measures to classify disease status. Together with the mechanistic platform in rodents, these translational findings lay the groundwork to create preventive individualized treatments targeting sex-specific changes in mitochondrial metabolism that may be subtle to early cognitive dysfunction of AD risk.",Molecular psychiatry
39186432,BIGFormer: A Graph Transformer With Local Structure Awareness for Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Imaging Genetic Data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly inheritable neurological disorder, and brain imaging genetics (BIG) has become a rapidly advancing field for comprehensive understanding its pathogenesis. However, most of the existing approaches underestimate the complexity of the interactions among factors that cause AD. To take full appreciate of these complexity interactions, we propose BIGFormer, a graph Transformer with local structural awareness, for AD diagnosis and identification of pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, the factors interaction graph is constructed with lesion brain regions and risk genes as nodes, where the connection between nodes intuitively represents the interaction between nodes. After that, a perception with local structure awareness is built to extract local structure around nodes, which is then injected into node representation. Then, the global reliance inference component assembles the local structure into higher-order structure, and multi-level interaction structures are jointly aggregated into a classification projection head for disease state prediction. Experimental results show that BIGFormer demonstrated superiority in four classification tasks on the AD neuroimaging initiative dataset and proved to identify biomarkers closely intimately related to AD.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics
39777850,Mapping amyloid beta predictors of entorhinal tau in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the entorhinal regions are key Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers, but the spatial Aβ pathways influencing tau pathology remain unclear. METHODS: We applied predictive modeling to identify Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) spatial patterns that predict entorhinal tau levels, future hippocampal volume, and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) scores at 5-year follow-up. The model was trained on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 237), incorporating amyloid-PET (positron emission tomography), tau-PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive data, and validated on Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) (N = 276). RESULTS: The model accurately predicted entorhinal tau levels (r = 0.48, p < 0.0001), future hippocampal volume (r = 0.24, p = 0.002), and PACC scores (r = 0.35, p < 0.0001) based on regional Aβ. DISCUSSION: Aβ in the rostral middle frontal, medial orbitofrontal, and striatal regions predict entorhinal tau levels, future hippocampal volume, and PACC scores, indicating their potential as early biomarkers in AD prediction models. HIGHLIGHTS: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging reveals amyloid beta (Aβ) patterns predicting entorhinal tau levels in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ in medial orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and nucleus accumbens best predicts tau. Aβ distribution in these regions predicts future hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Model validated with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) data sets, showing robustness and reproducibility. Findings suggest early Aβ patterns can aid in diagnosing AD and guide anti-Aβ therapies.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
40386807,"An exploratory analysis of bezisterim treatment associated with decreased biological age acceleration, and improved clinical measure and biomarker changes in mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Aging is the primary risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging drives cognitive impairment through multiple mechanisms involving oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and dysregulation of metabolic, immunologic, and hematologic systems. METHODS: In a 7-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04669028), we investigated the safety and activity of bezisterim, a first-in-class, oral, blood-brain barrier-permeable, anti-inflammatory agent on cognitive, molecular, biochemical, physiological, and biological aging parameters in a subset of 50 mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease participants. These participants had source-document-verified clinical measures and samples, and they completed the protocol. This study focuses on epigenetic, metabolic, biomarker, and cognitive measures in the exploratory biomarker population that completed the protocol. RESULTS: Bezisterim was associated with non-significant directional improvements in multiple measures of cognitive and functional performance compared to placebo, with correlations to biological age (determined by DNA methylation ""clocks"") and to metabolism, inflammation, and dementia biomarkers. In addition, clinical measures correlated with the extent of DNA methylation of certain cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in genes associated with metabolic inflammation and neurodegeneration. DISCUSSION: The results suggest the possible use of bezisterim to target the multifactorial processes underlying dementia.

39773540,Uncovering the epigenetic regulatory clues of PRRT1 in Alzheimer's disease: a strategy integrating multi-omics analysis with explainable machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a largely unexplored epigenetic landscape. OBJECTIVE: This study employs an innovative approach that integrates multi-omics analysis and explainable machine learning to explore the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the epigenetic signature of PRRT1 implicated in AD. METHODS: Through comprehensive DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiling, we identified distinct epigenetic signatures associated with gene PRRT1 expression in AD patient samples compared to healthy controls. Utilizing interpretable machine learning models and ELMAR analysis, we dissected the complex relationships between these epigenetic signatures and gene expression patterns, revealing novel regulatory elements and pathways. Finally, the epigenetic mechanisms of these genes were investigated experimentally. RESULTS: This study identified ten epigenetic signatures, constructed an interpretable AD diagnostic model, and utilized various bioinformatics methods to create an epigenomic map. Subsequently, the ELMAR R package was used to integrate multi-omics data and identify the upstream transcription factor MAZ for PRRT1. Finally, experiments confirmed the interaction between MAZ and PRRT1, which mediated apoptosis and autophagy in AD. CONCLUSION: This study adopts a strategy that integrates bioinformatics analysis with molecular experiments, providing new insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of PRRT1 in AD and demonstrating the importance of explainable machine learning in elucidating complex disease mechanisms.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
39827219,Novel synaptic markers predict early tau pathology and cognitive deficit in an asymptomatic population at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates closely with pathology in the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau pathology may spread via neural synapses. In a population of cognitively unimpaired elderly at elevated risk of AD, we investigated four cerebrospinal (CSF) markers of synaptic dysfunction and degeneration. Three of these (SYT1, SNAP25, and ADAM23) are derived from pre-synaptic structures, while ADAM22 reflects post-synaptic changes. All four markers correlated strongly with tau protein measures. In statistical models, SYT1 accounted for more than half the total variance in both total- and P(181)-tau levels. Observed correlations with CSF levels of Alzheimer amyloid-β (Aβ42) were somewhat weaker. In longitudinal data, baseline levels of ADAM22 and ADAM23 robustly predicted increase over time in both total- and P-tau. CSF SYT1 levels also correlated with PET image uptake of tau and (at a trend level) Aβ in areas of interest for early AD pathology. CSF SYT1 and SNAP25 levels correlated inversely with a global psychometric score and several of its domain subscales. In quantitative trait loci analyses, all four synaptic markers were associated with at least one AD genetic risk locus. Upon ""staging"" participants by their evidence of amyloid and tau pathology (A/T/N framework), the CSF synaptic markers were unexpectedly reduced in participants with CSF evidence of amyloid but not tau pathology. They were clearly elevated, however, in the CSF of persons with indications of both tau and amyloid pathology. These observations provide evidence for clear pre-synaptic degeneration in cognitively unimpaired persons with biomarker evidence of early AD pathology.",Molecular psychiatry
39723923,Simultaneous Imaging of pH and Peroxynitrite in the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondria: Revealing Organelle Interactions in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.,"pH and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) are two critical biomarkers to unveil the corresponding status of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Simultaneously monitoring pH and ONOO(-) fluctuations in the ER and mitochondria during AD progression is pivotal for clarifying the interplay between the disorders of the two organelles and revealing AD pathogenesis. Herein, we designed and synthesized a dual-channel fluorescent probe (DCFP) to visualize pH and ONOO(-) in the ER and mitochondria. DCFP possessed excellent sensitivity and selectivity to pH and ONOO(-) without spectral crosstalk and was utilized in monitoring the two analytes within AD model cells and larval zebrafish. Importantly, DCFP could preferentially target mitochondria in normal cells and be enriched in the ER after mitochondrial depolarization. With the aid of DCFP, the slower acidification rate of the ER than that of mitochondria induced by Aβ oligomers (AβOs) was first identified, which could be ascribed to the relief of the AβOs-triggered ER stress through the Ca(2+) migration from the ER to mitochondria. Moreover, continuous exposure to AβOs led to mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, accelerating the acidification and ONOO(-) overproduction within mitochondria. As a result, intracellular oxidative stress levels were elevated, further exacerbating ER stress and aggravating ER acidification in turn. The advanced understanding of the potential interplay between the ER and mitochondria in this work may offer new insights and methodologies for studying AD pathogenesis. The DCFP developed in this work could also be employed to study other diseases related to ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",Analytical chemistry
39873122,Subventricular Accumulation of Cu in the Aging Mouse Brain Does Not Associate with Anticipated Increases in Markers of Oxidative Stress.,"Natural aging is associated with mild memory loss and cognitive decline, and age is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. There is substantial evidence that oxidative stress is a major contributor to both natural aging and neurodegenerative disease, and coincidently, levels of redox active metals such as Fe and Cu are known to be elevated later in life. Recently, a pronounced age-related increase in Cu content has been reported to occur in mice and rats around a vital regulatory brain region, the subventricular zone of lateral ventricles. In our study herein, we have characterized lateral ventricle Cu content in a unique murine model of accelerated aging, senescence accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Our results confirm an age-related increase in ventricle Cu content, consistent with the studies by others in wild-type mice and rats. Specifically, we observed Cu content to increase over the time frame 1 to 5 months and 5 to 9 months, but interestingly, no significant increase occurred between 9 and 12 months (although brain Cu content at 12 months was significantly elevated relative to 1 and 5 month-old animals). Despite the magnitude of Cu increase observed within the cells that comprise the subventricular zone of lateral ventricles (average 3 mM Cu, with isolated subcellular concentrations of 17 mM), we did not detect spectroscopic markers of thiol oxidation, protein aggregation, or lipid oxidation. The lack of evidence for oxidative stress in ex vivo animal tissue is in contrast to in vitro studies demonstrating that thiol, protein, and lipid oxidation is pronounced at these Cu concentrations. We suggest that our findings most likely indicate that the Cu ions in this brain region are sequestered in an unreactive form, possibly extended chains of Cu-thiolate complexes, which do not readily redox cycle in the aqueous cytosol. These results also appear to partially challenge the long-held view that age-related increases in brain metal content drive oxidative stress as we did not observe a concomitant association between age-related Cu increase and markers of oxidative stress, nor did we observe a net increase in Cu content between mice aged 9 and 12 months.",ACS chemical neuroscience
39849149,Early-phase (18)F-Flortaucipir tau-PET as a proxy of brain metabolism in Alzheimer's disease: a comparison with (18)F-FDG-PET and early-phase amyloid-PET.,"PURPOSE: As dual-phase amyloid-PET can evaluate amyloid (A) and neurodegeneration (N) with a single tracer injection, dual-phase tau-PET might be able to provide both tau (T) and N. Our study aims to assess the association of early-phase tau-PET scans and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and their comparability in discriminating Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and differentiating neurodegenerative patterns. METHODS: 58 subjects evaluated at the Geneva Memory Center underwent dual-phase (18)F-Flortaucipir-PET with early-phase acquisition (eTAU) and (18)F-FDG-PET within 1 year. A subsample of 36 participants also underwent dual-phase amyloid-PET (eAMY). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated to assess the correlation of eTAU and their respective (18)F-FDG-PET and eAMY scans. Hypometabolism and hypoperfusion maps and their spatial overlap were also evaluated at the individual level visually and semiquantitatively. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to compare the discriminative power of eTAU, FDG, and eAMY SUVR between A-/T- and A+/T + participants. RESULTS: Strong positive correlations were found between eTAU and FDG SUVRs (r = 0.84, p < 0.001) and eTAU and eAMY SUVRs (r > 0.87, p < 0.001). Clusters of significant hypoperfusion with good correspondence to hypometabolism topographies were found at the individual level, independently of the underlying neurodegenerative patterns. Both eTAU and FDG SUVRs significantly distinguished A+/T + from A-/T- individuals (AUC(eTAU)=0.604, AUC(FDG)=0.748) with FDG performing better than eTAU (p = 0.04). eAMY and eTAU SUVR showed comparable discriminative power. CONCLUSION: Early-phase (18)F-Flortaucipir-PET can provide perfusion information closely related to brain regional glucose metabolism and perfusion measured by early-phase amyloid-PET, even if less accurate than FDG-PET as a biomarker for neurodegeneration.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging
39774485,"APOE4 and infectious diseases jointly contribute to brain glucose hypometabolism, a biomarker of Alzheimer's pathology: New findings from the ADNI.","BACKGROUND: Impaired brain glucose metabolism is a preclinical feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Infections may promote AD-related pathology. Therefore, we investigated the interplay between infections and APOE4, a strong genetic risk factor for AD. METHODS: We analyzed data on 1,509 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using multivariate linear regression models. The outcomes were rank-normalized hypometabolic convergence index (HCI), statistical regions of interest (SROI) for AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Marginal mean estimates for infections, stratified by APOE4 carrier status, were then computed. RESULTS: Prior infections were associated with greater HCI [β = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.27, p = 0.01]. The combined effects of infections and APOE4 carriers on HCI levels were significantly greater than either variable alone. Among APOE4 carriers, the estimated marginal mean was 0.62, rising to 0.77, with infections (p<0.001), indicating an interaction effect. Carriers with multiple infections showed greater hypometabolism (higher HCI), with an estimate of 0.44 (p = 0.01) compared to 0.11 (p = 0.08) for those with a single infection, revealing a dose-response relationship. The estimates for the association of infections with SROI AD and SROI MCI were β = -0.01 (p = 0.02) and β = -0.01 (p = 0.04), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that infections and APOE4 jointly contribute to brain glucose hypometabolism and AD pathology, supporting a ""multi-hit"" mechanism in AD development.",PloS one
39857095,Machine Learning-Based Alzheimer's Disease Stage Diagnosis Utilizing Blood Gene Expression and Clinical Data: A Comparative Investigation.,"Background/Objectives: This study presents a comparative analysis of the multistage diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), utilizing two distinct types of biomarkers: blood gene expression and clinical biomarker samples. Both of these samples, obtained from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were independently analyzed utilizing machine learning (ML)-based multiclassifiers. This study applied novel machine learning-based data augmentation techniques to gene expression profile data that are high-dimensional, low-sample-size (HDLSS) and inherently highly imbalanced. The investigation obtained the highest multiclassification performance to date in the multistage diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease utilizing the blood gene expression profiles of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. Based on the performance results obtained, and other factors such as early prediction capabilities, this study compares the efficacies of the two types of biomarkers for multistage diagnosis. This study presents the sole investigation in which multiclassification-based AD stage diagnosis was conducted utilizing blood gene expression data. We obtained the best multiclassification result in both modalities of the ADNI data in terms of F1-score and were able to identify new genetic biomarkers. Methods: The combination of the XGBoost and SFBS (Sequential Floating Backward Selection) methods was used to select the features. We were able to select the 95 most effective gene probe sets out of 49,386. For the clinical study data, eight of the most effective biomarkers were selected using SFBS. A deep learning (DL) classifier was used to identify the stages-cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)/dementia. DL, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB), and random forest (RF) classifiers were used for the AD stage detection from gene expression profile data. Because of the high data imbalance in genomic data, borderline oversampling/data augmentation was applied in the model training and original samples for validation. Results: Utilizing clinical data, the highest ROC AUC scores attained were 0.989, 0.927, and 0.907 for the identification of the CN, MCI, and dementia stages, respectively. The highest F1 scores achieved were 0.971, 0.939, and 0.886. Employing gene expression data, we obtained ROC AUC scores of 0.763, 0.761, and 0.706 for the CN, MCI, and dementia stages, respectively, and F1 scores of 0.71, 0.77, and 0.53 for CN, MCI, and dementia, respectively. Conclusions: This represents the best outcome to date for AD stage diagnosis from ADNI blood gene expression profile data utilizing multiclassification techniques. The results indicated that our multiclassification model effectively manages the imbalanced data of a high-dimension, low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature to identify samples of the minority class. MAPK14, PLG, FZD2, FXYD6, and TEP1 are among the novel genes identified as being associated with AD risk.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)"
38064237,Plasma cytokines profile in patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease: a comparative study in terms of inflammation.,"BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease inflict economic and health burdens on societies. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is accompanied by progressive degradation of memory, decision-making, and judgment. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and loss of balance. Extensive research has pinpointed inflammation as a cause of the onset and progression of both diseases. However, it has not been confirmed which one is more formidable in terms of inflammation. METHODS: To assess the extent of inflammation that is implicated in AD and PD and answer the question of which one is more inflammatory, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2), were measured in AD and PD patients as well as a healthy group. RESULTS: Our results showed a significant increase in IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IP-10, MCP-1, PEG2, and TNF-α in AD and PD patients compared with the control. Interestingly, IFN-γ did not manifest any significant difference in AD or PD patients compared with the control. CONCLUSION: As a hallmark of our results, it could be inferred that inflammation, as the underlying etiological cause, plays a more crucial role in PD compared with AD. Based on our results, it is proposed that anti-inflammatory remedies would be putatively more effective in PD rather than AD.",The International journal of neuroscience
39560002,Visual read of [F-18]florquinitau PET that includes and extends beyond the mesial temporal lobe is associated with increased plasma pTau217 and cognitive decline in a cohort that is enriched with risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Patterns of signal from tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) confined to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) or extended into the neocortex may be relevant for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research if they are linked to differential biomarker levels and cognitive decline. METHODS: Visual assessment of Tau-PET [F-18]florquinitau (FQT) exams from 728 initially non-demented older adults yielded four uptake groups: tau-negative (T-), MTL-only (T+(MTL)), neocortex-only (T+(Neo)), or both (T+(MTL&Neo)). Mixed effects models assessed group differences in retrospective cognitive and plasma pTau217 trajectories. RESULTS: T+(MTL&Neo) was the most common T+ group (n = 97; 93% A+) and exhibited the sharpest worsening in cognitive and pTau217 trajectories before tau PET. DISCUSSION: The T+(MTL&Neo) category represents an intermediate to advanced stage of AD preceded by rising ptau217 and progressive cognitive decline. The pTau217 finding suggests that A+, T+ in MTL or neocortex could represent early AD stages, with a higher likelihood of progressing to more advanced stages. HIGHLIGHTS: Visual assessments of Tau-PET FQT revealed four distinct uptake groups: tau-negative (T-), MTL-only (T+(MTL)), neocortex-only (T+(Neo)), or both (T+(MTL&Neo)). Amyloid positive participants in the T+(MTL) and T+(MTL&Neo) categories showed a retrospectively faster decline in their cognitive trajectories, and a sharper increase in pTau217 levels in plasma, compared to T-. The T+(MTL&Neo) group displayed sharper trajectories compared with the other Tau positive groups in both their cognitive scores and pTau217 plasma levels. Our results suggest that participants with Tau present in both MTL and neocortex represent an intermediate to advanced stage of AD, whereas participants with signals confined to either MTL or neocortex could represent earlier AD stages.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

There are multiple potential etiologies of MCI. While often presumed to be related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative causes are common. Wider availability of relatively non-invasive plasma AD biomarkers, such as p-tau217, can provide invaluable insights into MCI clinico-pathology and the associated implications for symptom etiology, prognosis (e.g., risk for progression to dementia), and treatment options. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this study was to evaluate differences between individuals with MCI with and without plasma p-tau217 biomarker evidence of AD (MCI(AD+) and MCI(AD-)) as well as a control group of clinically normal older adults with negative AD biomarkers (CN(AD-)). We evaluated group differences in demographics, recruitment, clinical scales, fluid biomarkers, and brain imaging. We further probed these factors as independent contributors to symptoms among MCI(AD-) participants, for whom symptom etiology is most poorly understood. Lastly, in a subset of participants followed longitudinally, we investigated how these factors related to odds of clinical progression to dementia. DESIGN: We conducted an observational cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical research study. Study groups were compared cross-sectionally on demographics, recruitment, clinical measures, and biomarkers (chi square analyses, analyses of covariance). Contributors to functional changes were evaluated with multiple linear regression. Factors associated with the odds of progression from MCI to dementia longitudinally were evaluated with binary logistic regression. SETTING: 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses included 378 older adults classified as CN(AD-) (N = 76, age 66.1 ± 7.2, 63.2% female, 23.7% non-Hispanic/White), MCI(AD-) (N = 198, age 68.9 ± 7.9, 51.5% female, 29.3% non-Hispanic/White), or MCI(AD+) (N = 104, age 73.9 ± 7.4, 52.9% female, 49.0% non-Hispanic/White). Longitudinal analyses focused on 207 participants with MCI (68.5% of cross-sectional MCI sample) followed for an average of 3 years. MEASUREMENTS: Demographics (age, sex, years of education, self-identified race and ethnicity, primary spoken language), National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center-defined clinical phenotypes (Clinically Normal, Impaired - Not MCI, Amnestic MCI, Nonamnestic MCI, Dementia), recruitment source (clinic-based versus community-based), genetics (APOE genotype), functional evaluation (Clinical Dementia Rating scale), global cognition (Mini Mental State Exam), vascular history (Vascular Burden Score), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q Total score), plasma biomarkers (ALZPath p-tau217, Quanterix Simoa-based GFAP and NfL), and brain imaging (grey matter volume in select AD-relevant regions of interest, global white matter hyperintensity volume). RESULTS: Among those with MCI, 104 (34.4%) had plasma biomarker evidence of AD. MCI(AD+) participants were more frequently recruited from clinic-based settings than MCI(AD-) (74.8% vs. 47.5%, p<.001). Over half (51.5%) of MCI(AD+) carried at least one APOE e4 allele compared to 26.6% of MCI(AD-) and 29.4% of CN(AD-) (p<.001). Both MCI(AD+) (p<.001, Cohen's d = 0.93) and MCI(AD-) (p<.001, d = 0.75) reported more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms than CN(AD.) MCI(AD+) had higher plasma GFAP and NfL than both MCI(AD-) (GFAP: p<.001, d = 0.88, NfL: p<.001, d = 0.86) and CN(AD-) (GFAP: p<.001, d = 0.80; NfL: p<.001, d = 0.89). For the AD signature region of interest, MCI(AD+) had lower volume than both CN(AD-) (p<.001, d = 0.78) and MCI(AD-) (p=.018, d = 0.39). For the hippocampus, both MCI(AD+) (p<.001, d = 0.87) and MCI(AD-) (p<.001, d = 0.64) had lower volume than CN(AD-). Longitudinally, older age (OR=1.14 [1.06-1.22], p<.001), higher levels of p-tau217 (OR=10.37 [3.00-35.02], p<.001) and higher neuropsychiatric symptoms (OR=1.19 [1.02-1.39], p=.023) were associated with higher odds of progression to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: MCI is etiologically heterogeneous. The presence of Alzheimer's pathology defined by elevated plasma p-tau217 in individuals with MCI significantly worsens prognosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may contribute to cognitive complaints and risk for progressive decline irrespective of AD pathology. Plasma p-tau217 can inform our understanding of base rates of different MCI phenotypes on a larger scale. As with other AD biomarkers, frequency of elevated plasma p-tau217 and odds of progression to dementia requires careful consideration of recruitment source (clinic- vs. community-based), especially across ethno-racially diverse older adults. Ongoing integration of emerging neurodegenerative disease biomarkers with detailed clinical evaluations will continue to improve treatment specificity and prognosis.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
40100818,Potential multiple disease progression pathways in female patients with Alzheimer's disease inferred from transcriptome and epigenome data of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical type of dementia for which therapeutic strategies have not yet been established. The database of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease study by the ENCODE consortium contains transcriptome and various epigenome data. Although the Rush AD database may contain a satisfactory amount of data for women, the amount of data for men remains insufficient. Here, based on an analysis of publicly available data from female patients, this study found that AD pathology appears to be nonuniform; AD patients were divided into several groups with differential gene expression patterns, including those related to cognitive function. First, cluster analysis was performed on individuals diagnosed with ""No Cognitive Impairment (NCI),"" ""Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease (AD)"" stages in clinical trials using gene expression, and multiple substages were identified across AD progression. The epigenome data, in particular genome-wide H3k4me3 distribution data, also supported the existence of multiple AD substages. However, APOE gene polymorphisms of individuals seemed to not correlate with disease stage. An inference of adjacency networks among substages, evaluated via partition-based graph abstraction using the gene expression profiles of individuals, suggested the possibility of multiple typical disease progression pathways from NCI to different AD substages through various MCI substages. These findings could refine biomarker discovery or inform personalized therapeutic approaches.",PloS one
39647753,Identification of walnut-derived peptide WNP-8 as a potential therapeutic agent and SIRT2 as a biomarker for cognitive deficiency: A label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics study.,"Aberrant autophagic flux and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, limited studies have been conducted on the relationship between the histone acetylation-particularly sirtuin 2 (SIRT2)-and autophagy in cognitive deficiency. We investigated the effects of a walnut-derived peptide (WNP-8) on SIRT2, synaptic plasticity, and autophagy and the involvement of SIRT2 in learning and memory. Using four-dimensional label-free quantitative proteomics, we analyzed hippocampal tissue from mice treated or not treated with WNP-8 and exposed to scopolamine and identified 71 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). A pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEPs were mostly located in the cytoplasm and involved in the negative regulation of cell proliferation and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, which are associated with SIRT2. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that pretreatment with WNP-8 significantly modulated the expression of synaptic and autophagic proteins in scopolamine-treated cells in both in vivo and in vitro models (p < .05). Notably, WNP-8 significantly reversed the level and morphology of synaptic plasticity and autophagic flux in PC12 cells that overexpressed SIRT2 (p < .05). Together, our results provide evidence of a link between SIRT2, autophagy, and synaptic plasticity in neurons and novel insights into a potential predictive biomarker that could be used to prevent and delay Alzheimer's disease.",International journal of biological macromolecules
39801050,Cross-sectional and prognostic associations of baseline [(18)F]GTP1 tau PET signal and white matter lesion volumes for cognitive and functional decline in prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau and white matter lesion pathology are associated with clinical severity and subsequent decline, but their relative relationships with clinical assessments remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine cross-sectional and prognostic associations between baseline [(18)F]GTP1 tau positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVRs) and T1 white matter hypointensity (WMHypo) volumes with clinical indices. METHODS: We analyzed participants with biomarker-confirmed prodromal (n = 127) or mild (n = 233) AD with baseline [(18)F]GTP1 tau PET and MRI and longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), 13-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) data. RESULTS: Higher baseline [(18)F]GTP1 SUVRs were independently associated with poorer baseline performance and faster rates of subsequent decline on all five clinical outcome measures. Higher baseline WMHypo volumes were independently associated with poorer baseline performance on the CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog13, RBANS, and MMSE and faster rates of subsequent decline on the CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL. CONCLUSIONS: The independent associations of tau and white matter lesion pathology with clinical decline in AD suggest future prognostic models should include both imaging modalities.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39919551,Assessment of neuroprotective potential of Cuscuta reflexa in aluminium chloride-induced experimental model of Alzheimer's disease: In vitro and in vivo studies.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cuscuta reflexa (family Convolvulaceae), commonly known as giant dodder or Amarbel, is a parasitic plant that has garnered attention in pharmacological research due to its diverse bioactive compounds and potential therapeutic applications. Scientific studies have validated its traditional uses in folk medicine, highlighting its pharmacological activities. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brain, leading to synaptic impairment and the gradual loss of neurons. Currently, no effective medication is available to treat the development and progression of the disease. Hence, there is a rising concern about using alternative therapy such as herbal medicine to limit the progression of AD and improve the quality of a patient's life with minimum side effects. The plant Cuscuta reflexa has traditionally been claimed to possess neuroprotective effects but has not yet been validated scientifically. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Cuscuta reflexa (CRE) to ameliorate the neurodegenerative effect of aluminium chloride (AlCl(3)) using in vitro and in vivo studies. METHODS: The neuroprotective activity of CRE was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo experimental models of AlCl(3)-induced AD. RESULTS: The in vitro study showed that CRE markedly reduced AlCl(3)-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The in vivo study using the AlCl(3)-induced AD rat model showed that CRE treatment improved learning and memory, as evaluated using the open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. CRE also showed the reduction in oxidative stress induced by AlCl(3) in the brains of the rats by virtue of the significant decrease in oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) and increase in the antioxidant parameters such as reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Further, CRE exhibited its cholinergic activity by lowering the AlCl(3)-induced enhanced levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brains of rats. Histopathological analysis of the brains of rats showed that CRE treatment prevented the reactive changes and the damage in the neuronal tissue caused due to the AlCl(3). CONCLUSION: Conclusively, CRE ameliorated AlCl(3)-induced neurobehavioural toxicity in the rat model of AD by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cholinergic and neuroprotective effects which suggests its use in the treatment of progressive neural damage and cognitive deficits in AD patients.",Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for
40233108,Vigna radiata extracts in pumpkin and soya bean oil: A novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.,"Vigna radiate also known as mung beans, contains various bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, and saponins. V. radiata therapeutic potential is enhanced by preparation of its extract in Pumpkin oil and soya bean oil by enrichment of bioactive compounds holding antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuro-protective properties. The research study was aimed was to explore the healing endeavors of V. radiate pumpkin and soya bean oil extract in rectification of neuro-motor dysfunction and mental health decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model. After preliminary physico-phytochemical characterization and GC-MS analysis, AD model was established by administration of oral D-galactose and aluminum chloride 150 mg/kg each for 42 days daily. V. radiate extract in pumpkin and soya bean oil at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg was administered and rivastigmine (3 milligrams per kilogram) to treatment animals. To determine the cognitive decline and neuro-coordination dysfunctions behavioral tests were performed along with biochemical, neurochemical and histopathological analysis. ELISA and real time polymerase chain reaction were carried out to estimate the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, Interleukine-6 and mRNA expression of neurodegenerative biomarkers. Gas chromatography Mass Spectrometry findings revealed the existence of favorable amount of neuro-defensive bioactive compounds in both oil extracts.V. radiate pumpkin and soya bean oil extract dose proportionally alleviated the behavioral dysfunctions, modulated the first line antioxidant enzymes and neurotransmitters s' level with anticholinesterase pursuits. The mRNA expression of AChE, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-1α and β secretase were downregulated by these extracts treatment. V. radiate oil extracts also modulated the neuro-inflammatory protein expression and histopathological hallmarks in AD model animals. Therefore, it is purposed that V. radiate enriched extract in pumpkin and soya bean oil could be used to treat AD like memory dysfunction and motor symptoms.",PloS one
39781894,"Comprehensive Approach for Sequential MALDI-MSI Analysis of Lipids, N-Glycans, and Peptides in Fresh-Frozen Rodent Brain Tissues.","Multiomics analysis of single tissue sections using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) provides comprehensive molecular insights. However, optimizing tissue sample preparation for MALDI-MSI to achieve high sensitivity and reproducibility for various biomolecules, such as lipids, N-glycans, and tryptic peptides, presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a robust and reproducible protocol for the comprehensive sequential analysis of the latter molecules using MALDI-MSI in fresh-frozen rodent brain tissue samples. The optimization process involved testing multiple organic solvents, which identified serial washing in ice-cold methanol, followed by chloroform as optimal for N-glycan analysis. Integrating this optimized protocol into MALDI-MSI workflows enabled comprehensive sequential analysis of lipids (in dual polarity mode), N-glycans, and tryptic peptides within the same tissue sections, enhancing both the efficiency and reliability. Validation across diverse rodent brain tissue samples confirmed the protocol's robustness and versatility. The optimized methodology was subsequently applied to a transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model (tgArcSwe) as a proof of concept. In the AD model, significant molecular alterations were observed in various sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid species, as well as in biantennary and GlcNAc-bisecting N-glycans, particularly in the cerebral cortex. These region-specific alterations are potentially associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation, which may contribute to cognitive and memory impairments. The proposed standardized methodology represents a significant advancement in neurobiological research, providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and laying the foundation for potential preclinical applications. It could aid the development of diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.",Analytical chemistry
39874376,Pre-treatment subjective sleep quality as a predictive biomarker of tDCS effects in preclinical Alzheimer's disease patients: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Despite transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated encouraging potential for modulating the circadian rhythm, little is known about how well and sustainably tDCS might improve the subjective sleep quality in older adults. This study sought to determine how tDCS affected sleep quality and cognition, as well as how well pre-treatment sleep quality predicted tDCS effects on domain-specific cognitive functions in patients with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (NCD-AD). METHODS: This clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of tDCS and cognitive training in mild NCD-AD patients (n =  201). Over the course of four weeks, patients were randomized to receive either tDCS plus working memory training, or sham tDCS plus working memory training, or tDCS plus controlled cognitive training. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measured subjective sleep quality. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) was used to evaluate domain-specific cognitive functions. RESULTS: Recurrent tDCS treatments enhanced subjective sleep quality and cognition considerably. The poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI >  5) who received tDCS treatment had more cognitive benefits (p =  0.031, Cohen's d =  0.605) and sleep improvements (p <  0.001, Cohen's d =  1.209) in comparison to cognitive training. Pre-treatment subjective sleep quality was linked to tDCS-induced improvement in memory function. CONCLUSION: During the course of two months, repeated tDCS could considerably enhance subjective sleep quality. For the cognitive benefits of the treatments, the status of pre-treatment subjective sleep quality is crucial. More thorough research is necessary to explore an efficient approach to managing comorbidities for preclinical AD patients.",PloS one
39838434,Machine learning models for dementia screening to classify brain amyloid positivity on positron emission tomography using blood markers and demographic characteristics: a retrospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Intracerebral amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is considered the initial observable event in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Efficient screening for amyloid pathology is critical for identifying patients for early treatment. This study developed machine learning models to classify positron emission tomography (PET) Aβ-positivity in participants with preclinical and prodromal AD using data accessible to primary care physicians. METHODS: This retrospective observational study assessed the classification performance of combinations of demographic characteristics, routine blood test results, and cognitive test scores to classify PET Aβ-positivity using machine learning. Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal cognitive function who visited Oita University Hospital or had participated in the USUKI study and met the study eligibility criteria were included. The primary endpoint was assessment of the classification performance of the presence or absence of intracerebral Aβ accumulation using five machine learning models (i.e., five combinations of variables), each constructed with three classification algorithms, resulting in a total of 15 patterns. L2-regularized logistic regression, and kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Elastic Net algorithms were used to construct the classification models using 34 pre-selected variables (12 demographic characteristics, 11 blood test results, 11 cognitive test results). RESULTS: Data from 262 records (260 unique participants) were analyzed. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) participant age was 73.8 (7.8) years. Using L2-regularized logistic regression, the mean receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (SD) in Model 0 (basic demographic characteristics) was 0.67 (0.01). Classification performance was similar in Model 1 (basic demographic characteristics and Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] subscores) and Model 2 (demographic characteristics and blood test results) with a cross-validated mean ROC AUC (SD) of 0.70 (0.01) for both. Model 3 (demographic characteristics, blood test results, MMSE subscores) and Model 4 (Model 3 and ApoE4 phenotype) showed improved performance with a mean ROC AUC (SD) of 0.73 (0.01) and 0.76 (0.01), respectively. In models using blood test results, thyroid-stimulating hormone and mean corpuscular volume tended to be the largest contributors to classification. Classification performances were similar using the SVM and Elastic Net algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning models used in this study were useful for classifying PET Aβ-positivity using data from routine physician visits.

39723490,Clinical validity and reproducibility of a visual rating scale for cingulate island sign in a real-world memory clinic: An FDG-PET/MRI study.,"PURPOSE: Brain [18F]FDG-PET is a supportive biomarker for cognitive impairment in Lewy bodies disease (LBD) showing reduced occipital metabolism and presence of the cingulate island sign (CIS), a relative preservation of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) metabolism compared with precuneus and cuneus. We assess validation, clinical utility, and reproducibility of a qualitative visual CIS scale in the differential diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a memory clinic setting. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients were studied: 36 LBD, of whom 30 with dementia (DLB) and 6 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-LB), and 31 AD (20 typical and 11 atypical presentations). They underwent FDG-PET/MRI scans and were followed for at least 24 months. The visual CIS rating scale was scored by a nuclear medicine physician and a neurologist independently. Qualitative CIS scores were validated with ROI-based semiquantitative FDG analysis. RESULTS: Mean CIS scores were 1.84 ± 1.69 for LBD and 0.9 ± 1.24 for AD (p = 0.001). With a cutoff CIS score ≥2, sensitivity was 0.56, and specificity 0.81 (accuracy 0.67). Positive CIS in patients with AD was due to atypical presentations. Negative CIS in LBD was due to (i) normal FDG-PET in MCI-LB or (ii) marked hypometabolism of both the PCC and cuneus. Visual CIS scores correlated with FDG-uptake (r = 0.45; p < 0.001) and held a high inter-specialists concordance. DISCUSSION: The visual CIS scale can be successfully scored by different specialists. Lower sensitivity is expected in cases of MCI-LB or dementia due to mixed LBD/AD changes. Specificity may be influenced by the inclusion of atypical AD cases.",European journal of neurology
39787209,Patient stratification by genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease is only effective in the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity.,"Case-only designs in longitudinal cohorts are a valuable resource for identifying disease-relevant genes, pathways, and novel targets influencing disease progression. This is particularly relevant in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where longitudinal cohorts measure disease ""progression,"" defined by rate of cognitive decline. Few of the identified drug targets for AD have been clinically tractable, and phenotypic heterogeneity is an obstacle to both clinical research and basic science. In four cohorts (n = 7241), we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) to discover novel targets associated with progression and assess causal relationships. We tested opportunities for patient stratification by deriving polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD risk and severity and tested the value of these scores in predicting progression. Genome-wide association studies identified no loci associated with progression at genome-wide significance (α = 5×10-8); MR analyses provided no significant evidence of an association between cognitive decline in AD patients and protein levels in brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma. Polygenic risk scores for AD risk did not reliably stratify fast from slow progressors; however, a deeper investigation found that APOE ε4 status predicts amyloid-β and tau positive versus negative patients (odds ratio for an additional APOE ε4 allele = 5.78 [95% confidence interval: 3.76-8.89], P<0.001) when restricting to a subset of patients with available CSF biomarker data. These results provided no evidence for large-effect, common-variant loci involved in the rate of memory decline, suggesting that patient stratification based on common genetic risk factors for progression may have limited utility. Where clinically relevant biomarkers suggest diagnostic heterogeneity, there is evidence that a priori identified genetic risk factors may have value in patient stratification. Mendelian randomization was less tractable due to the lack of large-effect loci, and future analyses with increased samples sizes are needed to replicate and validate our results.",PloS one
39582253,Biochemical Investigation of the Association of Apolipoprotein E Gene Allele Variations with Insulin Resistance and Amyloid-β Aggregation in Cardiovascular Disease.,"This article investigates the intricate associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene alleles variation, insulin resistance (IR) and amyloid-β aggregation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. A cohort of 250 patients exhibiting the symptoms of CVD and 50 control subjects participated in this study. After applying the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, the diseased group was further stratified into three categories: CVD+ (Alzheimer's disease) AD, CVD + (diabetes mellitus) DM and CVD + DM + AD. Blood samples were collected from all recruited participants for the biochemical analyses of lipid profile, glycaemic status, liver function enzymes, inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. Tetra amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) was employed for APOE gene analysis. Biochemical evaluations revealed the significant elevations in the serum levels of glucose, liver enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in CVD + DM + AD group. Conversely, the serum levels of insulin, HDL and hexokinase decreased in CVD + DM + AD group compared to the controls and other CVD groups. Tetra ARMS-PCR results indicated a higher percentage of the risk allele in CVD + DM + AD group when compared with the other groups. Our study elucidates the multifaceted cardiovascular risk factors contributing to IR and AD in CVD patients. Age-related risk factors, prevalence of APOE risk alleles and the impact of statin use on AD incidences were identified. These findings underscore the need for tailored preventive measures, particularly in APOEε4 and ε3/ε4 carriers with CVD. Further studies should delve into the knowledge-based protocols to comprehend the underlying mechanisms. Focusing on the therapeutic targets to prevent or delay DM and AD progression in CVDs, especially in APOEε4 carriers, is essential.",Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology
39725857,Higher CSF sTREM2 attenuates APOE ε4-related risk for amyloid pathology in cognitively intact adults: The CABLE study.,"The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein found in microglia within the brain, and its soluble form (sTREM2) has been shown to reduce amyloid deposition. Whether elevated TREM2-mediated microglial activity decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM2 attenuate the risk of APOE ε4-associated amyloid pathology. We included 877 cognitively intact subjects from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study, including APOE ε4 carriers (n = 136) and non-carriers (n = 741). The linear regression was used to examine the interaction effect between CSF sTREM2 levels and APOE ε4 status on CSF Aβ42 levels. Additionally, subgroup analyses stratified by sex and age were conducted. Our main finding was that higher concentrations of CSF sTREM2 attenuated the effect of APOE ε4 carriage (i.e., the sTREM2 × APOE ε4 interaction) on amyloid deposition (β = -2.701e-05, p = 0.023). Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of interaction was still significant only in male (p = 0.041) and mid-life (p = 0.013) subgroups. Our study suggested that in cognitively intact individuals, changes in sTREM2 levels are associated with biomarkers of AD, and higher concentrations of CSF sTREM2 attenuated the risk of APOE ε4-related amyloid pathology. The identified role of the sTREM2 × APOE ε4 interaction in amyloid pathology offers new insights into potential strategies for AD prevention in APOE ε4 carriers.",Journal of neurochemistry
39815147,Exploring Brain Imaging and Genetic Risk Factors in Different Progression States of Alzheimer's Disease Through OSnetNMF-Based Methods.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment, often preceded by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Multimodal imaging genetics integrates imaging and genetic data to gain a deeper understanding of disease progression and individual variations. This study focuses on exploring the mechanisms that drive the transition from normal cognition to MCI and ultimately to AD. As an effective joint feature extraction and dimensionality reduction method, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and its improved variants, particularly the network-based non-negative matrix factorization (netNMF), have been widely used in multimodal analysis to mine brain imaging and genetic data by considering the interactions between different features. However, many of these methods overlook the importance of the coefficient matrix and do not address issues related to data accuracy and feature redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose an orthogonal sparse network non-negative matrix factorization (OSnetNMF) algorithm, which introduces orthogonal and sparse constraints based on netNMF. By establishing linear relationships between structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and corresponding gene expression data, OSnetNMF reduces feature redundancy and decreases correlation between data, resulting in more accurate and reliable biomarker extraction. Experiments demonstrate that the OSnetNMF algorithm can accurately identify risk regions of interest (ROIs) and key genes that characterize AD progression, revealing significant trends in ROI pairs such as l4thVen-HIF1A, rBst-MPO, and rBst-PTK2B. Comparative experiments show that the improved algorithm outperforms traditional methods, identifying more disease-related biomarkers and achieving better reconstruction performance.",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN
39637966,Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau231) and total tau (t-tau) as prognostic markers of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest - a multicentre study.,"PURPOSE: We studied the promising Alzheimer biomarker plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-tau231) in a cohort of cardiac arrest patients who survived to intensive care to predict long-term neurological outcomes. We also compared it to total tau (t-tau), which has demonstrated predictive abilities of neurological outcome post-cardiac arrest. METHODS: This observational multicentre cohort study included 425 patients admitted to intensive care after cardiac arrest. Plasma p-tau231 was retrospectively analysed at admission, 12 and 48 h after cardiac arrest. The association of the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) with p-tau231 was analysed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). CPC was modelled using multivariate ordinal logistic regression, and the biomarkers' prognostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Increasing p-tau231 levels were significantly associated with worse CPC (p < 0.001). P-tau231 showed moderate prognostic abilities (AUC: 0.69 on admission, 0.72 at 12 h, and 0.71 at 48 h) for all patients but did not improve neurological prognostication after adjusting for clinical covariates. Elevated levels of t-tau were significantly associated with a worse outcome at all time points (p < 0.001). T-tau significantly improved neurological prognosis at 48 h after adjusting for covariates (AUC: 0.95, 95 % CI 0.93-0.98, p < 0.001) compared to the clinical covariate reference model (AUC: 0.88, 95 % CI 0.84-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Although p-tau231 showed moderate neurological prognostic ability, t-tau was a stronger predictor, particularly at 48 h, even after adjusting for clinical covariates.",Resuscitation
39807654,Clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 in identifying abnormal brain amyloid burden in an Asian cohort with high prevalence of concomitant cerebrovascular disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Using an Asian cohort with high prevalence of concomitant cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), we evaluated the performance of a plasma immunoassay for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) in detecting amyloid beta positivity (Aβ+) on positron emission tomography and cognitive decline, based on a three-range reference, which stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for Aβ+. METHODS: Brain amyloid status (Aβ- [n = 142] vs Aβ+ [n = 73]) on amyloid PET scans was assessed along with the plasma ALZpath p-tau217 assay to derive three-range reference points for PET Aβ+ based on 90% sensitivity (lower threshold) and 90% specificity (upper threshold). RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.923) outperformed routine clinical assessments (AUC = 0.760-0.819; p ≤ 0.003) and other plasma biomarkers (AUC = 0.817-0.834; p < 0.001). The high-risk group showed significantly higher rates of cognitive decline than the low-risk group. DISCUSSION: Risk stratification for PET Aβ+ based on a plasma p-tau217 assay demonstrated potential diagnostic and prognostic utility in an Asian cohort with concomitant CeVD. HIGHLIGHTS: The utility of plasma p-tau217 to detect brain amyloid beta pathology (Aβ+) was studied in an Asian cohort with concomitant cerebrovascular disease Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) showed superior utility in detecting Aβ+ compared to neuroimaging measures, clinical workup, or other blood biomarkers including p-tau181, glial fibrillary protein (GFAP), and Aβ Higher plasma p-tau217 correlated with faster cognitive decline Plasma p-tau217 shows promise as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in diverse populations.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39623809,"Evaluation of betanin-loaded liposomal nanocarriers in AlCl(3)-induced Alzheimer's disease in rats: Impact on cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and TREM2/ADAM10 pathways.","Betanin (BET) has been studied for its therapeutic benefits in various diseases, but its low bioavailability and uncertain brain penetration limit its efficacy. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore BET-loaded liposomal nanocarriers (LPN) as a novel treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)/DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways implicated in AD. In an AlCl(3)-induced AD rat model, 48 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, AlCl(3) (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), AlCl(3)+BET (100 mg/kg, per os), and AlCl(3)+BET LPN (25 mg/kg, intranasally), with treatments administered for 28 days. Morris water maze test and histopathological examination showed that BET LPN-treated rats had improved spatial and learning memory and less hippocampal and cortical degeneration compared with the AlCl(3) and oral BET groups. Mechanistically, BET LPN treatment corrected AD biomarkers, increased miR-132 and ADAM10 expression, and reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Additionally, BET LPN treatment suppressed the expression of TREM2, DAP12, ERK1/2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), showing greater improvement than oral BET. These findings suggest that BET LPN enhances cognitive function and neuroprotection in AD by modulating miR-132 and ADAM10 and inhibiting ERK1/2 and TREM2/DAP12 pathways, providing a more effective treatment compared with traditional oral BET administration.",Archiv der Pharmazie
39581748,Associations of demyelination in the right middle temporal gyrus and right praecuneus with visuospatial cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with impairments in not only memory but also visuospatial cognitive function. Despite its adverse effects on the quality of life, patients with early-stage AD are often neglected. Emerging evidence suggests that patients with AD exhibit increased vulnerability of myelin, a crucial component for neuronal conduction and survival. To test our hypothesis that myelin damage was associated with cognitive deficits in AD, we examined correlations of myelin integrity, quantified by T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) ratios, with visuospatial cognitive abilities and compared them between patients with AD and cognitively normal (CN) individuals. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with AD and 22 CN subjects were enrolled in this study. To assess subjects' visuo-constructive abilities, we employed the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy Test (ROCFT-c) paired with analysis of T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain images. Voxel-based associations between T1w/T2w ratios and ROCFT-c scores in the AD group were assessed, controlling for age and handedness (voxel threshold uncorrected P < 0.001, cluster threshold uncorrected P < 0.05). Additionally, we compared the T1w/T2w ratios of these identified brain regions between the AD and CN groups. RESULTS: The voxel-based analysis demonstrated positive correlations between T1w/T2w ratios and ROCFT-c scores in the right middle temporal gyrus and right praecuneus in patients with AD who exhibited significantly lower T1w/T2w ratios in the right middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.038) and a trend toward lower T1w/T2w ratios in the right praecuneus (P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated a strong association between reduced myelin integrity in the right middle temporal gyrus and right praecuneus and visuospatial cognitive dysfunction in patients with AD. These findings are believed to shed light on the neural basis of visuospatial processing in patients with AD, underlining the necessity for developing objective biomarkers for assessing patients' visuospatial cognitive function.",Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society
39885278,"Alzheimer's disease may develop from changes in the immune system, cell cycle, and protein processing following alterations in ribosome function.","The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing as society ages. The details of AD pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated, and a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the process leading up to the onset of AD would be helpful for understanding the mechanism. We performed an RNA sequencing analysis on a cohort of 1227 Japanese blood samples, representing 424 AD patients, 543 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 260 cognitively normal (CN) individuals. A total of 883 and 1169 statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between CN and MCI (CN-MCI) and between MCI and AD (MCI-AD), respectively. Pathway analyses using these DEGs, followed by protein-protein interaction network analysis, revealed key roles of ribosomal function in MCI progression, whereas immune responses, cell cycle, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum were involved in AD progression. Our findings indicate that the onset of AD might be associated with gene expression changes in the immune system, cell cycle, and protein processing following alterations in the expression of ribosomal protein genes during the MCI stage, although validation using brain tissue samples will be necessary in the future. Given the known effectiveness of delaying MCI progression in preventing AD, the genes related to ribosomal function might emerge as biomarkers for early diagnosis.",Scientific reports
39419711,Mediating role of obstructive sleep apnea in altering slow-wave activity and elevating Alzheimer's disease risk: Pilot study from a northern Taiwan cohort.,"OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with alterations in slow-wave activity during sleep, potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. This study investigated the associations between obstructive sleep apnea manifestations such as respiratory events, hypoxia, arousal, slow-wave patterns, and neurochemical biomarker levels. METHODS: Individuals with suspected obstructive sleep apnea underwent polysomnography. Sleep disorder indices, oxygen metrics, and slow-wave activity data were obtained from the polysomnography, and blood samples were taken the following morning to determine the plasma levels of total tau (T-Tau) and amyloid beta-peptide 42 (Aβ(42)) by using an ultrasensitive immunomagnetic reduction assay. Subsequently, the participants were categorized into groups with low and high Alzheimer's disease risk on the basis of their computed product Aβ(42) × T-Tau. Intergroup differences and the associations and mediation effects between sleep-related parameters and neurochemical biomarkers were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-two participants were enrolled, with 21 assigned to each of the low- and high-risk groups. High-risk individuals had a higher apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index (≥3%, ODI-3%), fraction of total sleep time with oxygen desaturation (SpO(2-)90% (TST)), and arousal index and greater peak-to-peak amplitude and slope in slow-wave activity, with a correspondingly shorter duration, than did low-risk individuals. Furthermore, indices such as the apnea-hypopnea index, ODI-3% and SpO(2-)90% (TST) were found to indirectly affect slow-wave activity, thereby raising the Aβ(42) × T-Tau level. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea manifestations, such as respiratory events and hypoxia, may influence slow-wave sleep activity (functioning as intermediaries) and may be linked to elevated neurochemical biomarker levels. However, a longitudinal study is necessary to determine causal relationships among these factors. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This research aims to bridge gaps in understanding how obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease, providing valuable knowledge for sleep and cognitive health.",Sleep health
39838256,Uncovering cerebral blood flow patterns corresponding to Amyloid-beta accumulations in patients across the Alzheimer's disease continuum using the arterial spin labeling.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia. Abnormal cerebral perfusion alterations, influenced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulations, have been implicated in cognitive decline along this spectrum. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42 levels and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes across the AD continuum using the Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) technique. METHODS: We analyzed data from 229 participants extracted from the ADNI cohort, comprising of 50 cognitively normal (CN), 13 subjective memory complaints (SMC), 83 early MCI (EMCI), 52 late MCI (LMCI), and 31 AD participants with complete ASL and CSF data. Correlations between Aβ1-42 levels and regional mean CBF values were assessed. Multiple linear regression models accounted for confounders, including age, gender, and education level. RESULTS: Preliminary unadjusted analyses revealed strong positive correlations between Aβ1-42 levels and CBF in multiple regions, predominantly in the AD group. After adjusting for confounders, significant correlations in AD participants emerged in the left pars triangularis and left caudal middle frontal cortex. In the LMCI group, significant associations were identified in the right lateral occipital cortex, right inferior parietal cortex, and left amygdala. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical role of Aβ-driven CBF alterations in regions associated with higher cognitive functions and suggest that these patterns may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and
39667582,"Discovery of novel fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors as anti-alzheimer agents via in-silico-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, DFT, and non-clinical studies.","AIM: To identify some novel fatty acid hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors that may contribute to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: In-silico pharmacophore modelling including ligand-based pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics modelling, density functional theory and in-silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies were employed for the retrieving of novel FAAH inhibitors. Further, these compounds were evaluated for FAAH inhibitory activity using an in vitro enzymatic assay, and later, an in vivo streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD model was examined in mice. RESULTS: Using an in-silico pharmacophore modelling process with molecular docking, molecular dynamic modelling, density functional theory and in-silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological analysis, three compounds (NCI1697, NCI1001and NCI1041) were retrieved. The in vitro FAAH activity assay kit (Fluorometric) was employed to examine the FAAH inhibitory activity of identified compounds. Further, in in-vivo studies, treatment with these compounds at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg doses orally for 10 days restored the STZ-induced memory deficits in mice, as evident in the radial arm and Morris's water maze assays. Also, these compounds ameliorated oxidative stress profiles and neuroinflammatory biomarkers in mice. Interestingly, STZ-induced disturbance in gene expressions related to AD pathophysiology including endocannabinoid signalling neuroinflammation and neuroimmune signalling were also restored after the treatment. Histopathological findings also confirmed the improvement in the organization of cells and reduction in vacuolation in mice hippocampal tissue in treated mice. CONCLUSION: The in-silico, in vitro and in-vivo findings collectively indicated that these compounds have impressive FAAH inhibitory activity and may be developed as therapeutic agents in the management of AD.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior"
39806094,"Common Variants in PLXNA4 and Correlation to Neuroimaging Phenotypes in Healthy, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's Disease Cohorts.","A comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) has validated the identification of the Plexin-A 4 (PLXNA4) gene as a novel susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, the precise role of PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of AD remains to be established. Consequently, this study is aimed at exploring the relationship between PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms and neuroimaging phenotypes intimately linked to AD. This study encompassed 812 subjects with PLXNA4 genotype data, procured from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Employing a tagging strategy, we identified five common variant sites within the PLXNA4 gene and assessed their associations with glucose metabolism, atrophy in AD-related brain regions (including the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus), and intracerebral Aβ deposition. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using a multiple linear regression model, with neuroimaging phenotypes as the dependent variable and PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms as the independent variable while incorporating APOE e4 carrier status, education level, age, and gender as covariates. The subjects were stratified into three groups based on their disease status: the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group, and the cognitively normal healthy control (CN) group. Within each group, we examined the associations between PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms and various neuroimaging phenotypes. Our study identified significant associations between the rs156676-A and rs78036292-G alleles and the baseline volumes of the anterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus, respectively, across the entire population. After 1 year of follow-up, a significant correlation was observed between the rs6467431-G allele and accelerated volumetric atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus in the overall population. Additionally, at the 2-year follow-up, significant correlations were observed between three PLXNA4 loci (rs1863015, rs6467431, rs67468325) and volumetric atrophy in the anterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and hippocampus across the entire population. Specifically, the rs1863015-G allele notably accelerated atrophy of the left middle temporal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus, whereas the A alleles of rs6467431 and rs67468325 markedly accelerated atrophy specifically in the bilateral hippocampus. Subgroup analysis further validated these findings. Additionally, in the baseline CN group, the rs78036292 allele showed a significant correlation with intracerebral Aβ deposition, while in the 2-year follow-up CN group, rs67468325 was significantly associated with alterations in glucose metabolism rates in the right cingulate gyrus. Our findings indicate that PLXNA4 genotypes may modulate the development of AD through their regulation of intracerebral Aβ deposition. Additionally, PLXNA4 genotypes are strongly associated with AD-related brain atrophy and glucose metabolism, suggesting that they may alter susceptibility to AD by modulating neurodegenerative biomarkers.",Molecular neurobiology
40585810,Multidimensional MRI reveals cortical astrogliosis linked to dementia in Alzheimer's disease.,"Despite the presence of significant Alzheimer's disease pathology, characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, some cognitively unimpaired elderly individuals do not inevitably develop dementia. Cortical astroglial inflammation, a ubiquitous feature of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, shows a strong correlation with cognitive impairment severity, highlighting the influence of factors beyond classical pathology. However, non-invasively imaging neuroinflammation, particularly astrogliosis, using MRI remains a significant challenge. Here we sought to address this challenge and to leverage multidimensional (MD) MRI, a powerful approach that combines relaxation with diffusion MR contrasts, to map cortical astrogliosis in the human brain by accessing sub-voxel information. Our goal was to investigate whether MD-MRI can map astroglial pathology in the cerebral cortex, and if so, whether it can distinguish cognitively normal state from dementia in the presence of hallmark Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. We adopted a multimodal approach by integrating histological and MRI analyses using human postmortem brain samples from two independent discovery and replication cohorts. Ex vivo cerebral cortical tissue specimens were derived from two groups-non-demented individuals with varying levels of postmortem Alzheimer's disease pathology and individuals with both Alzheimer's disease pathology and dementia-and scanned using 7 T MRI. We acquired and processed MD-MRI, diffusion tensor, and quantitative T(1) and T(2) MRI data, followed by histopathology on the same tissue. By co-registering MRI and microscopy data, we performed quantitative multimodal analyses, leveraging targeted immunostaining to assess MD-MRI sensitivity and specificity towards Aβ, pTau, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrogliosis. Our discovery analysis reveals a distinct MD-MRI signature of cortical astrogliosis, enabling the creation of predictive maps for cognitive state amid Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. Multiple linear regression analysis linked histological values to MRI changes, revealing that the MD-MRI cortical astrogliosis biomarker was significantly associated with GFAP burden (standardized β = 0.658/0.709, p (FDR) < 0.0001), but not with Aβ (standardized β = 0.009/0.120, p (FDR) = 0.913/0.274) or pTau (standardized β = -0.196/0.158, p (FDR) = 0.051/0.251), for the discovery/replication groups, respectively. Conversely, none of the conventional MRI parameters showed significant associations with GFAP burden in the cortex. Finally, we showed that the MD-MRI-derived astrogliosis biomarker is the only MRI measure capable of predicting cognitive state. While the extent to which pathological glial activation contributes to neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease is uncertain, developing a non-invasive imaging method to see its effects holds promise from a mechanistic perspective and as a potential predictor of cognitive outcomes.",Brain communications
39584314,Associations of neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric patterns with brain structural biomarkers and dementia risk: A latent class analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms are essential clinical manifestations of age-related cognitive impairment, yet their patterns of co-existence remain unclear through the cognitive continuum. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of person-centered cluster-derived patterns, based on a comprehensive collection of domain-specific cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments, with neuroimaging markers and dementia risk. METHODS: 641 participants were included in the analysis from memory clinics in Singapore. Latent class analysis was applied to define clusters of individuals with different clinical patterns. The associations between identified clinical groups with neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegeneration were analyzed using logistic regression models. Cox proportional hazard models were applied for incident dementia. RESULTS: Three latent classes differing in neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment were identified (Class 1 ""memory impairment only""; Class 2 ""global cognitive impairment""; Class 3 ""global cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment""). Compared with Class 1, Class 2 and 3 were associated with smaller brain volumes, moderate-to-severe cortical atrophy and medial temporal lobe atrophy, and the presence of all cerebrovascular lesions. Moreover, compared with Class 2, Class 3 had smaller brain volumes, moderate-to-severe cortical atrophy and presence of intracranial stenosis. Additionally, compared to Class 1, Class 2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.84, 95%CI 2.11-7.00), and Class 3 (HR = 6.92, 95%CI 2.84-16.83) showed an increased risk of incident dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Participants characterized by multi-domain cognitive impairment and co-occurrence of cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment showed the highest risk of incident dementia, which may be attributed to both neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
40575115,A novel PSEN2 mutation in amnestic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD): A familial case series.,"Familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is a rare form of dementia often caused by autosomal dominant mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2. We report a novel PSEN2 missense variant (c.359T > G, p.Ile120Ser) that has been detected in four siblings; three of whom are affected by predominantly amnestic EOAD or mild cognitive impairment in their fifties (supported by neuroimaging biomarkers), while the youngest sibling is currently asymptomatic at age 50. Two of the siblings were also heterozygous for a variant in PSEN1 (c.118_120del, p.Asp40del). Between the two genes, the PSEN2 variant was deemed to be likely pathogenic based on segregation with EOAD, imaging biomarker analyses, and bioinformatic analyses. Reporting genetic findings in familial EOAD cases can help in classifying their pathogenic significance and improving genetic conceptualization within Alzheimer's disease.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
39949405,High-frequency oscillations in epileptic and non-epileptic Alzheimer's disease patients and the differential effect of levetiracetam on the oscillations.,"Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of developing epilepsy together with cognitive decline. Early diagnosis or prediction of parameters associated with epileptic activity can greatly help in managing disease outcomes. Network hyperexcitability is a candidate of interest as a neurophysiological biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. High-frequency oscillations are increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers of hyperexcitability and epileptic activity. However, they have not yet been identified in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we measured high-frequency oscillations via magnetoencephalography recordings in Alzheimer's disease patients with and without epileptic activity, as part of a Phase 2a randomized, double blind clinical trial of the efficacy of levetiracetam to improve cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease. To measure the high-frequency oscillations, we used 10-min magnetoencephalography recordings (275-channel and sampling rate 1200-4000 Hz) during awake resting periods in participants with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls. Recordings from 14 Alzheimer's disease participants, with six having non-epileptic Alzheimer's disease (median age: 60.8, 2 M/4 F), eight having sub-clinical epileptic activity (median age: 54.9, 5 M/3 F) and eight as control (median age: 71, 5 M/3 F), were analysed using two software scripts: Delphos and a custom-made script, for detecting high-frequency oscillations. Levetiracetam 125 mg twice-a-day or placebo was administered for 4 weeks in between two magnetoencephalography recordings, and 4 weeks of washout before switching levetiracetam/placebo phases for each participant. High-frequency oscillations were categorized into ripples (80 to 250 Hz) and fast ripples (250 to 500 Hz). At baseline, Alzheimer's disease participants, both epileptic and non-epileptic had higher rate of ripples and fast ripples than controls in several left/right hemispheric sensor regions (P < 0.05). Additionally, compared to epileptic, non-epileptic had higher rate of ripples in left-frontal, left-temporal and cerebral fissure regions and higher rate of fast ripples in left-frontal regions (P < 0.05). In epileptic type, levetiracetam decreased ripples in bilateral-frontal, bilateral-occipital regions and cerebral fissure, whereas in non-epileptic type, levetiracetam increased both ripples and fast ripples in right central and left parietal regions, and ripples in the right parietal region (P < 0.05). Additionally, we found hemisphere asymmetry in epileptic type, with right temporal/occipital having more high-frequency oscillations than their counterpart region. Overall, Alzheimer's disease had a high level of high-frequency oscillations, with higher numbers observed in non-epileptic type. Levetiracetam decreased high-frequency oscillations in epileptic but increased high-frequency oscillations in non-epileptic. Thus, high-frequency oscillations can function as a biomarker of hyperexcitability in Alzheimer's disease and may be more pathological when asymmetric and coinciding with presence of epileptic activity. Levetiracetam has the potential for treating hyperactivity in patients with epileptic Alzheimer's disease.",Brain communications
40502223,Sex-Based Differences in the Association of Epigenetic Age Acceleration with Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers and Cognitive Measures.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive and functional decline. Biological sex has been linked to differences in lifetime AD risk, AD-related neuropathology, and the rate of cognitive decline, although the underlying biological mechanisms driving these disparities remain unclear. Epigenetic Age Acceleration-a metric derived from epigenetic aging clocks-has been associated with numerous aging-related conditions such as AD. Although there is promise in using Epigenetic age acceleration as a biomarker for several aging related diseases, the underlying mechanism that aging clocks are actually predicting is not well understood. In this study, we used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to examine how sex influences the relationship between age acceleration and cognitive performance as well as brain volume. Our findings suggest that, although epigenetic age acceleration can predict changes in brain structure, these changes don't appear to be different across sexes. Future research should focus on validating these findings in an external cohort and exploring them longitudinally.",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings. AMIA Joint Summits on
39642472,High CSF neurogranin level is related to lifetime reports of passive suicidal ideation in a population-based sample of older adults.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of markers of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage, neurogranin (Ng) and neurofilament light chain (NfL), with suicidal ideation in older adults. METHOD: The sample was obtained from the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies and included 316 dementia free individuals (151 women, 165 men, mean age 70.6) who underwent extensive psychiatric examinations and lumbar puncture (LP). Suicidal ideation was assessed using the Paykel questions. RESULTS: Past year suicidal ideation (any severity level) was reported by 9 (2.8%) participants while 58 (18.4%) reported experiencing such ideation during their lifetime. High CSF Ng level was associated with lifetime reports of life weariness (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.01-4.11, P = 0.048), death wishes (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.02-4.98, P = 0.044) and thoughts of taking one's own life (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.31-7.65, P = 0.010) in adjusted logistic regression models including self-reported lifetime depression as a covariate. The association between high CSF Ng level and lifetime suicidal ideation (all severity levels) remained in models adjusted for CSF levels of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ(42)), T-Tau and P-Tau. No relationship was seen between high CSF NfL and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: The association between high CSF Ng level and history of suicidal ideation suggests that synaptic dysfunction may be involved in the diathesis of passive suicidal ideation. CSF markers of neurodegeneration did not modify these findings.",Journal of psychiatric research
39723106,The CSF p-tau/β-amyloid 42 ratio correlates with brain structure and fibrillary β-amyloid deposition in cognitively unimpaired individuals at the earliest stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease.,"CSF concentrations of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and have been studied in relation to several neuropathological features both in patients and in cognitively unimpaired individuals. The CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, a biomarker combining information from both pathophysiological processes, has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring disease progression, even at pre-clinical stages. Here, we studied the association between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio with downstream markers of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease progression including brain structure, glucose metabolism, fibrillary Aβ deposition and cognitive performance in 234 cognitively unimpaired individuals, who underwent cognitive testing, a lumbar puncture, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-flutemetamol PET scanning. We evaluated both main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's disease risk factors, such as older age, female sex and the apoliporoptein E (APOE)-ɛ4 allele, in a priori defined regions of interest and further examined the associations on the whole-brain using voxel-wise regressions. In addition, as the association between CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain structure and function may be non-linear, we tested the interaction between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio and stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease defined using the amyloid (A) and tau (T) classification. We found significantly positive associations between CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and both cortical Aβ deposition and regional grey matter volume while no effect was observed for brain metabolism. A significant interaction with age indicated that, for the same level of CSF p-tau/Aβ42, older individuals displayed both increased Aβ deposition and lower grey matter volume, in widespread cortical areas. In addition, we found that women compared with men had a greater Aβ fibrillary accumulation in midline cortical areas and inferior temporal regions, for the same level of the CSF biomarker. The impact of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 on grey matter volume was modulated by AT stages, with A+T+ individuals displaying significantly less positive associations in areas of early atrophy in the Alzheimer's continuum. Finally, we found that sex and APOE-ɛ4 modulated the association between the CSF biomarker and episodic memory as well as abstract reasoning, respectively. Our data indicate that the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio is strongly associated with multiple downstream neuropathological events in cognitively unimpaired individuals and may thus serve as a potent biomarker to investigate the earliest changes in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease. Given that its impact on both Aβ deposition and grey matter volume is modulated by specific risk factors, our results highlight the need to take into account such predisposing variables in both clinical practice and prevention trials.",Brain communications
40092368,Uncovering atrophy progression pattern and mechanisms in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is associated with pre-symptomatic changes in brain morphometry and accumulation of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta pathology. Studying the development of brain changes prior to symptoms onset may lead to early diagnostic biomarkers and a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Alzheimer's disease pathology is thought to arise from a combination of protein accumulation and spreading via neural connections, but how these processes influence brain atrophy progression in the pre-symptomatic phases remains unclear. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (FHAD) have an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease, providing an opportunity to study the pre-symptomatic phase. Here, we used structural MRI from three databases (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer Disease and Montreal Adult Lifespan Study) to map atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease and assess the constraining effects of structural connectivity on atrophy progression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data up to 4 years were used to perform atrophy progression analysis in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. PET radiotracers were also used to quantify the distribution of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta protein isoforms at baseline. We first derived cortical atrophy progression maps using deformation-based morphometry from 153 FHAD, 156 Alzheimer's disease and 116 controls with similar age, education and sex at baseline. We next examined the spatial relationship between atrophy progression and spatial patterns of tau aggregates and amyloid-beta plaques deposition, structural connectivity and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. Our results show that there were similar patterns of atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease, notably in the cingulate, temporal and parietal cortices, with more widespread and severe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. Both tau and amyloid-beta pathology tended to accumulate in regions that were structurally connected in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease. The pattern of atrophy and its progression also aligned with existing structural connectivity in FHAD. In Alzheimer's disease, our findings suggest that atrophy progression results from pathology propagation that occurred earlier, on a previously intact connectome. Moreover, a relationship was found between serotonin receptor spatial distribution and atrophy progression in Alzheimer's disease. The current study demonstrates that regions showing atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease present with specific connectivity and cellular characteristics, uncovering some of the mechanisms involved in pre-clinical and clinical neurodegeneration.",Brain communications
40589622,"A high-accuracy, low-cost blood test for Alzheimer's disease: validating P-tau181/Aβ42 in real-world cohorts.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of plasma P-tau181/Aβ42 measured via flow cytometry as a cost-effective tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. METHODS: A cohort study involved 123 healthy controls, 60 AD/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 34 subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) patients, and 34 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. Plasma P-tau181 and Aβ42 levels were measured using flow cytometry and cross-validated with Single-molecule Array (SIMOA). Publicly available Chinese cohort data were reanalyzed for comparative performance. RESULTS: The P-tau181/Aβ42 ratio revealed significant differences between groups. A reference interval (0-0.109) achieved 96.2% diagnostic accuracy (95.0% sensitivity, 96.7% specificity) for AD versus controls, distinguishing AD from SIVD (88.3% accuracy) and FTD (86.2% accuracy). Flow cytometry-based P-tau181/Aβ42 showed 88.3% consistency with SIMOA-based P-tau217, while SIMOA-based P-tau181/Aβ42 achieved 92.3% accuracy.

39975465,Clinically meaningful outcomes in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias trials.,"On March 12-14, 2024, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) together with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) led a workshop exploring clinically meaningful changes in the context of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) clinical trials (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/workshops/clinically-meaningful-outcomes-ad-adrd-trials). The goals were to identify research gaps, opportunities, and tools to advance patient-centered, equitable assessment of clinically meaningful change focused on biomarker status, cognition, and everyday function. The workshop fostered robust, multidisciplinary discussion between lived experience experts, advocates, researchers, clinicians, funders, payers, and regulators. The workshop addressed the criteria used to assess whether an intervention has had a clinically meaningful impact, including consideration of both benefit and harm. Here, we report on (1) criteria to consider for development, testing, and selection of clinically meaningful outcomes in AD/ADRD clinical trials; (2) methods to validate and customize clinically meaningful outcomes that are fit-for-purpose; and (3) practices that will ensure that clinically meaningful outcomes are applicable to diverse populations. HIGHLIGHTS: Patient-Centered Outcomes: Inclusive AD/ADRD clinical trials incorporate assessments that reflect what matters most to those impacted by these diseases, including patient- and caregiver-reported outcome measures. Culturally Relevant Assessments: There is a need for culturally sensitive and equitable assessments to better serve diverse populations in AD/ADRD research. Framework for Clinically Meaningful Change: We present a framework for defining and evaluating clinically meaningful outcomes in AD/ADRD trials, tailored to diverse stages of disease progression. Interdisciplinary Approach: We draw on insights from a multidisciplinary workshop, fostering collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and lived experience experts to advance the field.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39868112,MiRNA-501-3p and MiRNA-502-3p: A Promising Biomarker Panel for Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) lacks a less invasive and early detectable biomarker. Here, we investigated the biomarker potential of miR-501-3p and miR-502-3p using different AD sources. METHODS: MiR-501-3p and miR-502-3p expressions were evaluated in AD CSF exosomes, serum exosomes, familial and sporadic AD fibroblasts and B-lymphocytes by qRT-PCR analysis. Further, miR-501-3p and miR-502-3p expressions were analyzed in APP, Tau cells and media exosomes. RESULTS: MiR-501-3p and miR-502-3p expressions were significantly upregulated in AD CSF exosomes relative to controls. MiRNA levels were high in accordance with amyloid plaque and NFT density in multiple brain regions. Similarly, both miRNAs were elevated in AD and MCI serum exosomes compared to controls. MiR-502-3p expression was high in fAD and sAD B-lymphocytes. Finally, miR-501-3p and miR-502-3p expression were elevated intracellularly and secreted extracellularly in response to APP and Tau pathology. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that miR-501-3p and miR-502-3p could be promising biomarkers for AD.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
40151521,Plasma biomarker trajectories: Impact of AD genetic risk and clinical progression.,"INTRODUCTION: We examined long-term plasma biomarker trajectories among participants who were cognitively unimpaired and primarily middle aged at baseline and whether trajectories differed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk and among those who developed cognitive impairment. METHODS: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)(42)/Aβ(40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau)(181), neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells, and chitinase 3-like protein 1 were measured longitudinally in 177 BIOCARD participants (M baseline age = 57.7 years; M follow-up = 15.8 years), including 57 who developed cognitive impairment. Measures of AD genetic risk included apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and an AD polygenic risk score (AD-PRS). RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, APOE ε4 carriers had lower Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) and greater longitudinal increases in p-tau(181) and GFAP; in contrast, the AD-PRS (excluding the APOE region) was associated with greater declines in Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Rates of increase in p-tau(181), NfL, and GFAP were greater among those who later developed cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: Monitoring changes in plasma p-tau(181), NfL, and GFAP may be particularly informative during preclinical AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We examined plasma biomarker changes in cognitively normal individuals over 15.8 years.Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 was related to lower amyloid beta (Aβ)(42)/Aβ(40) and greater increases in phosphorylated tau (p-tau)(181) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).In APOE ε4 non-carriers, higher Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score was related to greater Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) declines.P-tau(181), NfL, and GFAP increases were greater among those who progressed to mild cognitive impairment.Results highlight the predictive value of plasma biomarkers during preclinical AD.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39724536,Blood-Based Biomarkers and Risk of Onset of Mild Cognitive Impairment Over the Short and Long Term.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Blood-based biomarkers of amyloid and tau have been shown to predict Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. Much less is known about their ability to predict risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an earlier disease stage. This study examined whether levels of blood biomarkers of amyloid (Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio), tau (p-tau(181)), neurodegeneration (NfL), and glial activation and neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], YKL40, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 [sTREM2]) collected when participants were cognitively normal are associated with the time to onset of MCI. METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from the longitudinal observational BIOCARD study provided blood plasma at their baseline evaluation (""baseline 1""). A second ""baseline"" specimen (collected using slightly different procedures) was evaluated for participants who were still cognitively normal approximately 7 years later. The plasma assays were based on the NeuroToolKit (cobas Elecsys assays, Roche Diagnostics). Cox regression models tested the association of biomarker levels with time to MCI symptom onset, separately for both baselines. RESULTS: Participants included 271 individuals at ""baseline 1"" (mean age = 57.5 years, 60.5% female, including 82 who progressed to MCI/dementia) and 202 individuals at ""baseline 2"" (mean age = 64.5 years, 62.4% female, including 31 progressors). The mean clinical follow-up was 15.5 years for ""baseline 1"" and 9.9 years for ""baseline 2."" For both baselines, lower plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) ratio (both hazard ratios, HRs ≤ 0.69, 95% CIs ≤ 0.55-0.87, p ≤ 0.034), higher GFAP (HRs ≥ 1.83, CIs ≥ 1.28-2.60, p < 0.002), and a higher ratio of p-tau(181)/(Aβ(42)/Aβ(40)) (HRs ≥ 1.64, CIs ≥ 1.25-2.13, p ≤ 0.001) were each associated with an earlier time to MCI symptom onset. For baseline 2, higher p-tau(181) (HR = 2.07, CI = 1.12-3.83, p = 0.021) and higher NfL (HR = 1.75, CI = 0.99-3.10, p = 0.05) were also associated with earlier MCI symptom onset for progression within 7 years. When combining biomarkers, neither GFAP nor NFL was associated with MCI symptom onset after accounting for AD biomarker levels (e.g., p-tau(181)/(Aβ(42)/Aβ(40))), which remained significant. YKL40 and sTREM2 were not associated with MCI onset. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that during preclinical AD, more abnormal blood biomarker levels of amyloid (Aβ(42)/Aβ(40)), p-tau(181), neurodegeneration (NfL), and neuroinflammation (GFAP) individually are associated with progression from normal cognition to MCI, but the AD-nonspecific neurodegeneration and inflammation markers were not associated with symptom onset after accounting for amyloid and p-tau levels.",Neurology
40226382,Stratifying risk of Alzheimer's disease in healthy middle-aged individuals with machine learning.,"Alzheimer's disease has a prolonged asymptomatic phase during which pathological changes accumulate before clinical symptoms emerge. This study aimed to stratify the risk of clinical disease to inform future disease-modifying treatments. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis from participants in the Emory Healthy Brain Study was used to classify individuals based on amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), total tau (tTau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) levels. Cognitively normal (CN), biomarker-positive (CN)/BM+individuals were identified using a tTau: Aβ42 ratio > 0.24, determined by Gaussian mixture models. CN/BM+ individuals (n = 134) were classified as having asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD), while CN, biomarker-negative (CN/BM-) individuals served as controls (n = 134). Cognitively symptomatic, biomarker-positive individuals with an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis confirmed by the Emory Cognitive Neurology Clinic were labelled as Alzheimer's disease (n = 134). Study groups were matched for age, sex, race and education. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from these matched Emory Healthy Brain Study groups were analysed using targeted proteomics via selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The targeted cerebrospinal fluid panel included 75 peptides from 58 unique proteins. Machine learning approaches identified a subset of eight peptides (ADQDTIR, AQALEQAK, ELQAAQAR, EPVAGDAVPGPK, IASNTQSR, LGADMEDVCGR, VVSSIEQK, YDNSLK) that distinguished between CN/BM- and symptomatic Alzheimer's disease samples with a binary classifier area under the curve performance of 0.98. Using these eight peptides, Emory Healthy Brain Study AsymAD cases were further stratified into 'Control-like' and 'Alzheimer's disease-like' subgroups, representing varying levels of risk for developing clinical disease. The eight peptides were evaluated in an independent dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, effectively distinguishing CN/BM- from symptomatic Alzheimer's disease cases (area under the curve = 0.89) and stratifying AsymAD individuals into control-like and Alzheimer's disease-like subgroups (area under the curve = 0.89). In the absence of matched longitudinal data, an established cross-sectional event-based disease progression model was employed to assess the generalizability of these peptides for risk stratification. In summary, results from two independent modelling methods and datasets demonstrate that the identified eight peptides effectively stratify the risk of progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",Brain communications
39763634,Contributions of connectional pathways to shaping Alzheimer's disease pathologies.,"Four important imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, namely grey matter atrophy, glucose hypometabolism and amyloid-β and tau deposition, follow stereotypical spatial distributions shaped by the brain network of structural and functional connections. In this case-control study, we combined several predictors reflecting various possible mechanisms of spreading through structural and functional pathways to predict the topography of the four biomarkers in amyloid-positive patients while controlling for the effect of spatial distance along the cortex. For each biomarker, we quantified the relative contribution of each predictor to the variance explained by the model. We also compared the contribution between apolipoprotein E-ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. We found that topological proximity to areas of maximal pathology through the functional connectome explained significant parts of variance for all biomarkers and that functional pathways totalized more than 30% of contributions for hypometabolism and amyloid load. By contrast, atrophy and tau load were mainly predicted by structural pathways, with major contributions from inter-regional diffusion. The ɛ4 allele modulated contributions to the four biomarkers in a way consistent with compromised brain connectomics in carriers. Our approach can be used to assess the contribution of concurrent mechanisms in other neurodegenerative diseases and the possible modifying impact of relevant factors on this contribution.",Brain communications
40376568,Nanobiosensors in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis: A promising pathway for early detection.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. Early diagnosis remains a challenge due to the slow progression of symptoms and the limitations of current diagnostic methods. Nanobiosensors, leveraging the high sensitivity and specificity of nanotechnology, offer a promising, noninvasive, and cost-effective approach for detecting disease biomarkers at ultra-low concentrations. This review highlights recent advancements in nanobiosensor technology, including the integration of gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes, which have significantly enhanced biomarker detection precision. Furthermore, it examines the advantages of nanobiosensors over traditional diagnostic techniques, such as improved sensitivity, rapid detection, and minimal invasiveness. The potential of these innovative sensors to revolutionize early disease detection and improve patient outcomes is discussed, along with existing challenges in clinical translation, including stability, reproducibility, and regulatory considerations. Addressing these limitations will be crucial for integrating nanobiosensors into routine clinical practice and advancing personalized medicine for neurodegenerative disorders.",Digital health

39830279,The ratio of plasma pTau217 to Aβ42 outperforms individual measurements in detecting brain amyloidosis.,"IMPORTANCE: Early detection of brain amyloidosis (Aβ+) is pivotal for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and optimizing patient management, especially in light of emerging treatments. While plasma biomarkers are promising, their combined diagnostic value through specific ratios remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of plasma pTau isoform (pTau181 and pTau217) to Aβ42 ratios in detecting Aβ+ status. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 423 participants from the multicenter prospective ALZAN cohort, recruited for cognitive complaints. Aβ+ status was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Validation of the key findings was performed in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, where Aβ+ status was determined using PET imaging. EXPOSURES: Plasma biomarkers (pTau181, pTau217, Aβ40, Aβ42) were measured using immunoassays and mass spectrometry, with specific ratios calculated. In the ALZAN cohort, the impact of confounding factors such as age, renal function, ApoE4 status, body mass index, and the delay between blood collection and processing was also evaluated to assess their influence on biomarker concentrations and diagnostic performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers and their ratios for detecting Aβ+ status. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients classified as low, intermediate, or high risk for Aβ+ using a two-cutoff approach. RESULTS: The pTau181/Aβ42 ratio matched the diagnostic performance of pTau217 with AUC of 0.911 (0.880-0.936). The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy in the ALZAN cohort, with an AUC of 0.927 (0.898-0.950), outperforming individual biomarkers. Both ratios effectively mitigated confounding factors, such as variations in renal function, and were particularly excellent in identifying Aβ+ status in individuals with early cognitive decline. Validation in the ADNI cohort confirmed these findings, with consistent performance across different measurement methods. The two-cutoff workflow using pTau217/Aβ42 reduced the intermediate-risk zone from 16% to 8%, enhancing stratification for clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio offers superior diagnostic accuracy for detecting Aβ+ compared to individual biomarkers and reduces diagnostic uncertainty. These findings highlight the clinical utility of plasma biomarker ratios for early AD detection, paving the way for broader implementation in clinical and research settings.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
39886322,Serum biomarkers as prognostic markers for Alzheimer's disease in a clinical setting.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and phosphorylated tau (pTau) have shown promising prognostic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their applicability in clinical settings where comorbidities are prevalent remains uncertain. METHODS: Simoa assays quantified GFAP, NfL, and pTau181 in retrospectively retrieved prediagnostic serum samples from 102 AD patients and 21 non-AD controls. RESULTS: Higher serum GFAP levels predicted earlier clinical presentation and faster subsequent Mini-Mental State Examination decline in AD patients. Serum NfL levels were increased in patients with arterial hypertension (AHT), kidney dysfunction, and a history of stroke and only demonstrated predictive value for time to clinical AD presentation after adjustment for these comorbidities. Serum pTau181 instability during long-term storage at -20°C prevented its prognostic evaluation in retrospectively retrieved serum samples. DISCUSSION: Serum GFAP is a robust prognostic marker for AD progression, whereas NfL is impacted by various comorbidities, which complicates the interpretation of its prognostic value. HIGHLIGHTS: Serum GFAP levels predict time to clinical AD presentation.Serum NfL levels are increased by hypertension, kidney disease, and stroke history.Prognostic value of serum NfL in AD is only evident after comorbidity correction.Serum levels of GFAP, but not NfL, increase over time within prediagnostic AD stages.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39839076,"Perspective: Minimally clinically important ""symptomatic"" benefit associated with disease modification resulting from anti-amyloid immunotherapy.","Despite some skepticism regarding the amyloid hypothesis, there is growing evidence that clearing amyloid by targeting specific species of amyloid (plaque, oligomers, fibrils, and protofibrils) for removal has therapeutic benefits. Specifically, there is growing evidence that, in mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), robust and aggressive removal of amyloid can slow cognitive decline as measured by global instruments, composite measures, and cognitive testing. Furthermore, clinical efficacy signals coupled with clear biomarker changes provide the first evidence of disease modification. This effect seems to be in addition to symptomatic treatments and opens speculation that the effect of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies might be clinically meaningful through symptomatic amelioration that is a result of disease modification. HIGHLIGHTS: Clearance of brain amyloid plaques may lead to a clinical benefit in patients with early AD.Aggregated Aβ may play a role in both disease expression and progression.Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies might be clinically meaningful through symptomatic amelioration resulting from disease modification.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39917031,Diagnostic potential of urinary CX3CL1 for amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The role of the chemokine CX3CL1 in the processes of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is well-established. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic potential of urinary CX3CL1 levels in distinguishing between AD patients, those experiencing amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) individuals. METHODS: A cohort comprising 516 CN individuals across various age groups, 102 AD patients, and 65 subjects with aMCI was assembled, alongside 93 age- and sex-matched CN controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to quantify urinary CX3CL1 levels. RESULTS: Urinary CX3CL1 concentrations exhibited an age-dependent increase and demonstrated a positive correlation with age. Comparatively, AD patients exhibited significantly elevated urinary CX3CL1 levels when contrasted with both the CN controls and the aMCI cohort. Conversely, aMCI patients displayed urinary CX3CL1 levels that were notably reduced in comparison to both the AD and CN groups. CONCLUSION: Urinary CX3CL1 levels correlate with the aging process and may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for both amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).",Frontiers in aging neuroscience

METHODS: We tested the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool applied to neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment for staging and causal hypothesis, which are the two recommended workflow steps guiding the next one recommending optimal biomarkers to be used for a biological diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders, according to intersocietal recommendations. Moreover, we assessed the AI performance in predicting the progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-dementia. RESULTS: For the three-class classification of staging (n patients = 426), the inter-rater AI-humans agreement was substantial for both healthy subjects/subjective cognitive impairment/worried-well vs. all the remaining groups (rest) (Cohen's κ = 0.81) and mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia vs. rest κ = 0.70) classification, almost perfect for moderate/severe dementia vs. rest κ =0.90) classification. For the three-class classification of causal hypotheses (n = 112), the AI performance vs. biomarker-based diagnosis was: positive predictive value 91% [95% CI: 84-96%]; negative predictive value 100%, and accuracy 91% [84-96%].

However, the relationship between imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, especially in the context of (18)Fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET), remains insufficiently understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the evaluation of the relationship between (18)F-FDG-PET and other common fluid and imaging AD-biomarkers in a clinical cohort of patients with cognitive decline and suspected AD. METHODS: We included n = 90 patients with cognitive decline and clinically suspected AD that underwent (18)F-FDG-PET imagining at our facility. Clinical and imaging data including patient characteristics, CSF biomarkers, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (18)F-FDG-PET and (18)F-Florbetaben-PET were retrospectively analyzed. PET images were quantified in several brain regions. RESULTS: (18)F-FDG uptake correlated with CSF amyloid-β (Aβ)(40), Aβ(42), and the Aβ(42/40) ratio in several brain regions, but not with regional (18)F-Florbetaben uptake. (18)F-FDG uptake inversely correlated with t-tau and p-tau in CSF. Furthermore, a correlation between MMSE and (18)F-FDG uptake was also detected in several brain regions. (18)F-FDG-PET and its combination with CSF markers showed the highest predictive power for disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the potential of integrating (18)F-FDG-PET with CSF biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of AD, emphasizing the complexity and regional specificity of biomarker interactions in neurodegeneration.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
39723571,NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Altered Mitophagy Are Key Pathways in Inclusion Body Myositis.,"BACKGROUND: Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most prevalent muscle disease in adults for which no current treatment exists. The pathogenesis of IBM remains poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to explore the interplay between inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in IBM. METHODS: The study population consisted of 38 IBM patients and 22 age- and sex-matched controls without a myopathy. Mean age was 62.9 years (SD = 9) in IBM group and 59.7 (10) in controls. Bulk RNA sequencing, Meso Scale Discovery electrochemiluminescence (ECL), western blotting, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were performed on frozen muscle samples from the study participants. RESULTS: We demonstrated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBM muscle samples, with the NLRP3 inflammasome being the most upregulated pathway on RNA sequencing, along with increased expression of NLRP3 and ASC proteins in IBM group. NLRP3 RNA levels most strongly correlated with TLR7 (correlation coefficient ρ = 0.91) and complement activation-related genes, and inversely correlated with several mitochondria-related genes among others. On muscle histopathology, there was increased NRLP3 immunoreactivity in both inflammatory cells and muscle fibres. Mitophagy is critical for removing damaged mitochondria and preventing the formation of a vicious cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction-NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Herein, we showed altered mitophagy, as witnessed by the elevated levels of p-S65-Ubiquitin, a mitophagy marker, in muscle lysates from IBM patients compared to controls (median of 114.3 vs. 81.25 ECL units, p = 0.005). The p-S65-Ubiquitin levels were most significantly elevated in IBM males compared to male controls (136 vs. 83.5 ECL units; p = 0.013), whereas IBM females had milder nonsignificant elevation compared to female controls (97.25 vs. 69 ECL units, p = 0.31). On muscle histopathology, p-S65-Ubiquitin aggregates accumulated in muscle fibres that were mostly Type 2 and devoid of cytochrome-c-oxidase reactivity. NLRP3 RNA levels correlated with p-S65-Ubiquitin levels in both sexes (males: ρ = 0.48, females: ρ = 0.54) but with loss of muscle strength, as reflected by the manual motor test score, only in males (males: ρ = 0.62, females: ρ = -0.14). Lastly, we identified sex-specific molecular pathways in IBM. Females had upregulation of pathways related to response to stress, which could conceivably offset some of the pathomechanisms of IBM, while males had upregulation of pathways related to cell adhesion and migration. CONCLUSIONS: There is activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBM, along with altered mitophagy, particularly in males, which is of potential therapeutic significance. These findings suggest sex-specific mechanisms in IBM that warrant further investigation.","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle"
39886321,Inflammation biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease: A pilot study using NULISAseq.,"INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence links amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation with inflammation. This pilot study investigated the use of an immunoassay panel to map biomarker changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we evaluated the stability of protein quantification after multiple freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). METHODS: The nucleic acid-linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) inflammation panel measured 203 proteins in serum samples of individuals with (n = 31) and without (n = 31) AD pathology. Linear models, adjusted for age and sex, contrasted protein expression across groups. RESULTS: After multiple-testing adjustments, glial fibrillary acidic protein (p < 0.001) and S100A12 (p < 0.001) were significantly changed in the presence of AD pathology. Furthermore, they correlated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (phosphorylated tau-181 [p-tau181], tau, and Aβ42). Additional markers were nominally changed between groups. Five FTCs caused minimal changes in measurements with the NULISA inflammation panel. DISCUSSION: Monitoring of inflammation in AD, using the 200-plex NULISA panel, demonstrates changes in peripherally circulating inflammation-related proteins. Contrary to previous reports, FTCs had minimal impact on the quantification of inflammatory markers. HIGHLIGHTS: The novel nucleic acid-linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) inflammation panel, which includes 200 protein biomarkers, was used.The panel was used for the first time in serum from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).The protein S100A12 was identified as a potential biomarker for AD.Inflammation markers were stable in up to five freeze-thaw cycles.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39997520,The Use and Understanding of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Routine Specialist Care: A Survey Among German Memory Clinics.,"Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and is important for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the expansion of biomarker-based diagnostics, the aim of this study is to clarify the current attitudes towards and the use of MCI, and MCI due to AD, in German memory clinics. Methods: An online survey (50 items) was performed in 2022 among specialized clinicians (N = 45) in German memory clinics to assess the use of MCI and biomarkers in current diagnosis and treatment. Attitudinal and frequency items were assessed with a five-point numeric scale (strongly disagree = 1 to completely agree = 5 and never = 1 to always = 5, respectively). Results: All respondents used MCI as a clinical diagnosis. The benefits of diagnosing MCI were labeling deficits as disease symptoms (M = 4.4, SD = 0.7), improving coping with symptoms (M = 4.1, SD = 0.9), and motivating risk reduction activities (M = 4.0, SD = 0.9). Overall, 37 respondents used specialized diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD, and all had access to biomarker diagnostics. Patients with MCI due to AD received more frequent counseling on memory training (p < 0.001), other non-pharmacological treatments (p < 0.001), and antidementive drug treatment (p < 0.001) than patients with MCI of other etiologies. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed significantly more frequently to patients with MCI due to AD (p < 0.001) compared to other MCI patients. Conclusions: MCI is commonly used as a clinical diagnosis in German memory clinics. AD biomarker assessment is well established and influences patient counseling and treatment recommendations.","Geriatrics (Basel, Switzerland)"
40391185,Sex differences in story recall decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Stage II pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease is defined by the presence of increased amyloid-beta evidenced by fluid and/or imaging biomarkers, in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. Previous research suggests that pre-clinical sex differences exist on measures of story recall, such as the Wechsler memory scale-revised logical memory test total score. However, sex differences on a composite metric of proper names from that test have not been investigated, and the relationships between sex and amyloid positivity on longitudinal logical memory measures are unclear. We examined longitudinal trajectories of total score and proper names by sex (Aim 1), and by the combination of sex and amyloid status (Aim 2). N = 457 Wisconsin registry for Alzheimer's prevention participants with PET Pittsburgh compound B-assessed amyloid status (+/-) were included. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the interaction between sex and age at visit (the time variable), and sex and amyloid+/- on longitudinal total and proper name scores. Aim 1 analyses showed a main effect such that female participants, on average, scored higher than males on both total and proper name recall. The interaction between sex and age was not statistically significant, indicating that both sexes experienced a similar average rate of annual decline. Aim 2 analyses showed that amyloid positive participants, regardless of sex, showed steeper declines compared to amyloid negative, female participants (reference group). Thus, while female participants generally outperformed males on story recall measures, the impact of amyloid burden on longitudinal story recall trajectories was not significantly more pronounced in females.

The interplay between Aβ formation and clearance is predominantly modulated by a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10, α-secretase) and β-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1), the two pivotal enzymes in both non-amyloidogenic/amyloidogenic and amyloidolytic pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that aberrations in ADAM10 and BACE1 expression, activity, and function in the brain of AD patients also manifest in peripheral fluids, suggesting their potential as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature by exploring the roles of ADAM10 and BACE1 in AD, spanning from their involvement as pathological AD drivers to their potential utility as promising biomarkers.",Current pharmaceutical design
39944545,From pixels to prognosis: radiomics and AI in Alzheimer's disease management.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, poses a growing global health challenge due to an aging population. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for optimizing treatment and management, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fall short in addressing the complexity of AD pathology. Recent advancements in radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) offer novel solutions by integrating quantitative imaging features and machine learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic and prognostic precision. This review explores the application of radiomics and AI in AD, focusing on key imaging modalities such as PET and MRI, as well as multimodal approaches combining structural and functional data. We discuss the potential of these technologies to identify disease-specific biomarkers, predict disease progression, and guide personalized interventions. Additionally, the review addresses critical challenges, including data standardization, model interpretability, and the integration of AI into clinical workflows. By highlighting current achievements and identifying future directions, this article underscores the transformative potential of AI-driven radiomics in reshaping AD diagnostics and care.",Frontiers in neurology
39822290,A longitudinal study of functional brain complexity in progressive Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Cross-sectional resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies have revealed altered complexity with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages. The current study conducted longitudinal rsfMRI complexity analyses in AD. METHODS: Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were implemented to evaluate altered rates of disease progression in complexity across disease groups. RESULTS: The LME models revealed complexity of the higher frequency in the CNtoMCI group (those converted from cognitively normal [CN] to mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) decayed faster over time versus CN in the prefrontal and lateral occipital cortex; complexity of the lower frequency decayed faster in AD versus CN in various frontal and temporal regions (p < 0.05 & Benjamini-Hochberg corrected with q < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Local functional brain activities decayed in the early stage of the disease, and long-range communications were impacted in the later stage. Our study demonstrated longitudinal changes in AD-related rsfMRI complexity, indicating its potential as an imaging biomarker of AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted longitudinal resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) complexity analyses using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.Higher-frequency complexity in the CNtoMCI group (those transitioning from cognitively normal [CN] to mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) was found to decay faster over time compared to CN, specifically in the prefrontal and lateral occipital cortex.Lower-frequency complexity was found to decay faster in AD versus CN in various frontal and temporal regions.This study demonstrated that longitudinal changes in rsfMRI complexity could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39981365,Identification of blood plasma protein ratios for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls using machine learning.,"Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is essential for effective treatment and the development of therapies that modify disease progression. Developing sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tools is crucial for improving clinical outcomes and advancing our understanding of this condition. Liquid biopsy techniques, especially those involving plasma biomarkers, provide a promising noninvasive method for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. In this study, we analyzed the plasma proteomic profiles of 38 healthy individuals, with an average age of 66.5 years, and 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease, with an average age of 79.7 years. Proteins in the plasma were quantified using specialized panels designed for proteomic extension assays. Through computational analysis using a linear support vector machine algorithm, we identified 82 differentially expressed proteins between the two groups. From these, we calculated 6642 possible protein ratios and identified specific combinations of these ratios as significant features for distinguishing between individuals with Alzheimer's disease and healthy individuals. Notably, the protein ratios kynureninase to macrophage scavenger receptor type 1, Neurocan to protogenin, and interleukin-5 receptor alpha to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 1 achieving accuracy up to 98 % in differentiating between the two groups. This study underscores the potential of leveraging protein relationships, expressed as ratios, in advancing Alzheimer's disease diagnostics. Furthermore, our findings highlight the promise of liquid biopsy techniques as a noninvasive and accurate approach for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease using blood plasma.",Heliyon
39822297,Older US adults' experiences with and views about cognitive screening and blood biomarker testing for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Dementia is underdiagnosed in the United States. Understanding of older adults' experiences with screening is needed to optimize diagnosis. METHODS: US adults ages 65 to 80 (N = 1298) were surveyed on experiences with cognitive screening and blood biomarker (BBM) testing. Regression models estimated associations between characteristics and screening use. RESULTS: Most older adults were aware of screening (71%); 41% reported ever being screened. Older age, higher education, retirement, poorer health, and family history of dementia were associated with higher odds of screening; Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian race/ethnicity were associated with lower odds (p < .05). Most older adults were unaware of BBM (81%); few wanted testing immediately (9%). Although older adults held positive views about screening and BBM, half reported concerns about distress or stigma if tests indicated risk. DISCUSSION: Cognitive screening rates remain low. Older adults view screening and BBM as useful to inform health decisions but have concerns about potential harms. HIGHLIGHTS: Only one in five older US adults report having cognitive screening in the past year.Sociodemographic and health factors may influence whether older adults receive cognitive screening.Most older adults have positive views about cognitive screening and BBM testing.Many older adults would be concerned about distress or stigma if test result indicated dementia risk.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40134415,Early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease through data fusion of MRI and DTI images using the YOLOv11 neural network.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, affecting over 55 million people globally, with numbers expected to rise dramatically. Early detection and classification of AD are crucial for improving patient outcomes and slowing disease progression. However, conventional diagnostic approaches often fail to provide accurate classification in the early stages. This paper proposes a novel approach using advanced computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems and the YOLOv11 neural network for early detection and classification of AD. The YOLOv11 model leverages its advanced object detection capabilities to simultaneously localize and classify AD-related biomarkers by integrating multimodal data fusion of T2-weighted MRI and DTI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected and annotated based on known AD biomarkers, and the YOLOv11 model was trained to classify AD into four stages: Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The model achieved exceptional performance, with 93.6% precision, 91.6% recall, and 96.7% mAP50, demonstrating its ability to identify subtle biomarkers by combining MRI and DTI modalities. This work highlights the novelty of using YOLOv11 for simultaneous detection and classification, offering a promising strategy for early-stage AD diagnosis and classification.",Frontiers in neuroscience
40046342,Biological signatures in the Alzheimer's continuum discriminate between diagnosis-related and -unrelated associations to ATN categories.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias have a multifactorial aetiology and heterogeneous biology. The current study aims to identify different biological signatures in a deeply phenotyped memory clinic patient population. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed 49 pre-specified proteins using a multiplex antibody-based suspension bead array in 278 CSF samples from the real-world research database and biobank at the Karolinska University Hospital Memory Clinic, Solna, Sweden. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of subjective cognitive decline (N = 151), mild cognitive impairment (N = 61), Alzheimer's disease (N = 47), or other diagnoses (N = 19; vascular dementias, alcohol-related dementia, unspecified dementias, or other amnesias) were included. Principal component analyses were performed, and resulting principal components (PCs) were tested for associations with clinical variables and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (CSF biomarkers beta-amyloid 42, beta-amyloid 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181, phosphorylated tau 181/beta-amyloid 42). PC 1 (explaining 52% of the variance between patients) was associated with the clinical Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers beta-amyloid 42, phosphorylated tau 181, and total tau but not with Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration imaging markers, cognitive performance, or clinical diagnosis. PC 2 (explaining 9% of the variance) displayed an inflammatory profile with high contributions of chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and significant correlation to CSF free light chain kappa. In contrast to PC 1, PC 3 (explaining 5% of the variance) showed associations with all the clinical Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers, the imaging markers, cognitive impairment and clinical diagnosis. Serpin family A member 3 (SERPINA3), chitinase 1 (CHIT1), and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) contributed most to PC 3. PC 4 (explaining 4% of the variance) exhibited an inflammatory profile distinct from PC 2, with the largest contributions from TREM2, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) and complement C9. The component was associated with peripheral inflammation. We found that CSF protein profiles in a memory clinic cohort reflect molecular differences across diagnostic groups. Our results emphasize that real-world memory clinic patients can have different ongoing biological processes despite receiving the same diagnosis. In the future, this information could be utilized to identify patient endotypes and uncover precision biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.",Brain communications
39868208,Classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment from Normal Cognition: fMRI Complexity Matches Tau PET Performance.,"BACKGROUND: Tau protein accumulation is closely linked to synaptic and neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in progressive cognitive decline. Although tau-PET imaging is a direct biomarker of tau pathology, it is costly, carries radiation risks, and is not widely accessible. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) complexity-an entropy-based measure of BOLD signal variation-has been proposed as a non-invasive surrogate biomarker of early neuronal dysfunction associated with tau pathology. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether fMRI-based brain complexity (sample entropy and multiscale entropy) can match or exceed tau-PET in classifying cognitively normal (CN) versus cognitively impaired (MCI/AD) individuals. And to investigate and compare the most influential network regions-of-interest (ROIs) for classification between fMRI complexity and tau-PET, thereby identifying key neuroanatomical correlates of AD-related changes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study employing 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) classification with five-fold cross-validation and leave-one-network-out analysis. SETTING: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-seven older adults (age 72.5 ± 7.5 years), including 95 CN, 45 MCI, and 7 AD. MEASUREMENTS: We created whole-brain complexity maps from rs-fMRI and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) maps from tau-PET. Each modality was separately fed into CNN classifiers. Region-based analyses (leave-one-network-out) were performed to identify critical ROIs for classification. RESULTS: fMRI complexity showed classification accuracy comparable to tau-PET yet surpassed it in F1-score (0.64 vs. 0.61) and area under the curve (AUC; 0.73 vs. 0.67). Salience and dorsal attention networks contributed most to fMRI-based classification, and a dorsal attention network contributed most to tau-PET-based classification. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI complexity performs similarly to tau-PET in detecting cognitive impairment related to AD and identifies partially distinct critical ROIs, suggesting an alternative, radiation-free imaging biomarker for earlier detection and broader clinical application.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
39575564,Cerebrospinal fluid levels of NfM in relation to NfL and pNfH as prognostic markers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic potential of neurofilament medium chain (NfM) in CSF from patients with ALS and explore its relationship with the extensively studied neurofilament light chain (NfL) and phosphorylated heavy chain (pNfH). METHOD: CSF levels of NfL, NfM, and pNfH were analyzed in 235 samples from patients with ALS, ALS mimics, and healthy controls in a well-characterized cohort from Karolinska ALS Clinical Research Center in Stockholm, Sweden. NfM levels were analyzed using an antibody-based suspension bead-array and NfL and pNfH levels were measured using ELISA. Clinical data, including ALS Revised Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), and survival outcomes were utilized for disease progression estimations. RESULT: Increased NfM levels were observed in patients with ALS compared with mimics and healthy controls. Similarly, higher NfM levels were found in fast compared with slow progressing patients for baseline and longitudinal progression when evaluating both total and subscores of ALSFRS-R. These findings were consistent with the results observed for NfL and pNfH. All three proteins, used individually as well as in combination, showed comparable performance when classifying fast vs slow progressing patients (AUCs 0.78-0.85). For all neurofilaments, higher survival probability was observed for patients with low CSF levels. CONCLUSION: Based on this cross-sectional study, the prognostic value provided by NfM aligns with the more established markers, NfL and pNfH. Additional investigations with independent cohorts and longitudinal studies are needed to further assess the potential added value of NfM.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration
39860641,Plasma Endothelin-1 Levels: Non-Predictors of Alzheimer's Disease Reveal Age Correlation in African American Women.,"Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. Contributing biological factors that explain this disparity have been elusive. Moreover, non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AD are needed. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstrictive factor linked to cerebral vascular disease pathology and neuronal injury, could provide insights to better understand racial disparities in AD. As a potent vasoconstrictive peptide that regulates contractions in smooth muscle, endothelial cells, and pericytes, ET-1 may result in cerebral vascular constriction, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion; over time, this may result in neuronal injury, contributing to the pathology of AD. The role of the ET-1 system as a driver of ethnic disparities in AD requires further investigation. In the United States (U.S.), ET-1 dysregulation in Hispanic/Latinx (H/L) ethnic populations has largely been unexplored. Genetics linking ET-1 dysregulation and racial disparities in AD also require further investigation. In this study, we examined the role of the ET-1 protein in human plasma as a potential biomarker with predictive value for correlating with the development of AD by age, race, and sex. Methods: We examined ET-1 protein levels using quantitative mass spectrometry in AA and NHW patients with AD, along with controls. Results: A partial correlation between age at draw and ET-1, stratified by race and sex, while controlling for AD status, was significant for female AAs (r = 0.385, p = 0.016). When the data were not stratified but controlled for AD status, the partial correlation between age at draw and ET-1 was not significant (r = 0.108, p = 0.259). Conclusions: Based on the small number of plasma specimens and no plasma specimens from H/L individuals with AD, we conclude that ET-1 was clearly not a significant factor in predicting AD in this study and will require a larger scale study for validation.",Journal of clinical medicine
40343003,Multi-target neuroprotection by dl-PHPB in APP/PS1 mice: a proteomic analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Dl-PHPB [potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl) benzoate] demonstrates robust neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), significantly ameliorating cognitive deficits and pathological hallmarks. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The current study primarily focused on elucidating dl-PHPB's neuroprotective mechanisms and identifying potential targets in preclinical AD models. METHODS: Comparative proteomic analyses were performed on APP/PS1 mice orally administered either dl-PHPB (30 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 3 months, alongside vehicle-treated wild-type (WT) non-transgenic littermates as controls. Total proteins were separated using two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed protein spots were identified via LC-MS/MS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results revealed 11 altered proteins in the cortex and 10 in the hippocampus between the WT and APP/PS1 groups treated with vehicle. Following dl-PHPB treatment, 12 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the cortex and 9 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. These proteins are primarily involved in energy metabolism, neuronal structure, protein trafficking, inflammatory and oxidative responses, and amyloid β (Aβ) and Tau processes, among which several proteins were validated as potential therapeutic targets. Notably, the expression levels of cofilin-2 and VDAC1 in APP/PS1 mice were restored to near-normal levels by the treatment with dl-PHPB, memantine, or donepezil, and further clinical validation is required to establish their utility as AD biomarkers for therapeutic efficacy.",Frontiers in pharmacology
39886067,Evaluating conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease with structural MRI: a machine learning study.,"Alzheimer's disease is a disabling neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective treatment currently exists. To predict the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease could be crucial for patients' outcome, but current Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are invasive, time consuming or expensive. Thus, developing MRI-based computational methods for Alzheimer's disease early diagnosis would be essential to narrow down the phenotypic measures predictive of cognitive decline. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is associated with higher risk for Alzheimer's disease, and here, we aimed to identify MRI-based quantitative rules to predict aMCI to possible Alzheimer's disease conversion, applying different machine learning algorithms sequentially. At baseline, T1-weighted brain images were collected for 104 aMCI patients and processed to obtain 146 volumetric measures of cerebral grey matter regions [regions of interest (ROIs)]. One year later, patients were classified as converters (aMCI-c = 32) or non-converters, i.e. clinically and neuropsychologically stable (aMCI-s = 72) based on cognitive performance. Feature selection was performed by random forest (RF), and the identified seven ROIs volumetric data were used to implement support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Both SVM and DT reached an average accuracy of 86% in identifying aMCI-c and aMCI-s. DT found a critical threshold volume of the right entorhinal cortex (EC-r) as the first feature for differentiating aMCI-c/aMCI-s. Almost all aMCI-c had an EC-r volume <1286 mm(3), while more than half of the aMCI-s patients had a volume above the identified threshold for this structure. Other key regions for the classification between aMCI-c/aMCI-s were the left lateral occipital (LOC-l), the middle temporal gyrus and the temporal pole cortices. Our study reinforces previous evidence suggesting that the morphometry of the EC-r and LOC-l best predicts aMCI to Alzheimer's disease conversion. Further investigations are needed prior to deeming our findings as a broadly applicable predictive framework. However, here, a first indication was derived for volumetric thresholds that, being easy to obtain, may assist in early identification of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice, thus contributing to establishing MRI as a useful non-invasive prognostic instrument for dementia onset.",Brain communications
39825149,Somatic CAG repeat expansion in blood associates with biomarkers of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease decades before clinical motor diagnosis.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with the age at which characteristic symptoms manifest strongly influenced by inherited HTT CAG length. Somatic CAG expansion occurs throughout life and understanding the impact of somatic expansion on neurodegeneration is key to developing therapeutic targets. In 57 HD gene expanded (HDGE) individuals, ~23 years before their predicted clinical motor diagnosis, no significant decline in clinical, cognitive or neuropsychiatric function was observed over 4.5 years compared with 46 controls (false discovery rate (FDR) > 0.3). However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers showed very early signs of neurodegeneration in HDGE with elevated neurofilament light (NfL) protein, an indicator of neuroaxonal damage (FDR = 3.2 × 10(-12)), and reduced proenkephalin (PENK), a surrogate marker for the state of striatal medium spiny neurons (FDR = 2.6 × 10(-3)), accompanied by brain atrophy, predominantly in the caudate (FDR = 5.5 × 10(-10)) and putamen (FDR = 1.2 × 10(-9)). Longitudinal increase in somatic CAG repeat expansion ratio (SER) in blood was a significant predictor of subsequent caudate (FDR = 0.072) and putamen (FDR = 0.148) atrophy. Atypical loss of interruption HTT repeat structures, known to predict earlier age at clinical motor diagnosis, was associated with substantially faster caudate and putamen atrophy. We provide evidence in living humans that the influence of CAG length on HD neuropathology is mediated by somatic CAG repeat expansion. These critical mechanistic insights into the earliest neurodegenerative changes will inform the design of preventative clinical trials aimed at modulating somatic expansion.

39886066,Performance and validation of a digital memory test across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Digital cognitive testing using online platforms has emerged as a potentially transformative tool in clinical neuroscience. In theory, it could provide a powerful means of screening for and tracking cognitive performance in people at risk of developing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigate whether digital metrics derived from an in-person administered, tablet-based short-term memory task-the 'What was where?' Oxford Memory Task-were able to clinically stratify patients at different points within the Alzheimer's disease continuum and to track disease progression over time. Performance of these metrics compared to traditional neuropsychological pen-and-paper screening tests of cognition was also analysed. A total of 325 people participated in this study: 49 patients with subjective cognitive decline, 57 with mild cognitive impairment, 63 with Alzheimer's disease dementia and 156 elderly healthy controls. Most digital metrics were able to discriminate between healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment and between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients. Some, including Absolute Localization Error, also differed significantly between patients with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Identification accuracy was the best predictor of hippocampal atrophy, performing as well as standard screening neuropsychological tests. A linear support vector model combining digital metrics achieved high accuracy and performed at par with standard testing in discriminating between elderly healthy controls and subjective cognitive decline (area under the curve 0.82) and between subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (area under the curve 0.92), while performing worse in classifying between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients (area under the curve 0.75). Memory imprecision was able to predict cognitive decline on standard cognitive tests over one year. Overall, these findings show how it might be possible to use a digital memory test in clinics and clinical trial contexts to stratify and track performance across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.",Brain communications
40065917,Broad repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus in Alzheimer's disease: A rationale and study design.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process. METHODS: We will conduct a two-stage trial of large-coil rTMS targeting the precuneus (a key hub in the DMN affected by AD) in 54 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome focused primarily on determining tolerability and feasibility and secondarily focused on determining short-term efficacy for memory. The first stage will involve 5 to 10 participants receiving open-label active treatment to refine the protocol. The following second stage will consist of a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to study feasibility and tolerability while exploring target engagement and short-term efficacy for memory. Participants will undergo 16 total rTMS brain stimulation sessions over the course of 5 weeks. A full course of open-label active treatment will be offered as an extension to the sham group after unblinding. Outcomes will focus on completion rates and adverse events to demonstrate feasibility and tolerability. Further exploratory outcomes will include neuropsychological assessments, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers to demonstrate the feasibility of collection and explore preliminary changes in these measures. RESULTS: We anticipate this treatment is feasible and tolerable and may show evidence of target engagement and clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: Should we achieve expected positive outcomes in feasibility and tolerability, this will justify future work focusing on clear demonstrations of clinical efficacy and biomarker engagement, as well as enhancement of generalizability and scalability. HIGHLIGHTS: Induction-to-maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though recent methods require intensive personalization.We propose here a trial design of precuneus rTMS in mild-to-early-moderate AD dementia using exclusively off-the-shelf equipment and protocol modifications to reduce participant burden.Our two novel modifications from prior work are (1) using a larger rTMS coil, and (2) consolidating the induction phase of treatment.This trial focuses primarily on tolerability and feasibility while exploring clinical measures of efficacy and biomarkers of target engagement.Our trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06597942.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

However, the functional role of GGT5 in the development of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of GGT5 on cognitive function and brain pathology in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the underlying mechanism. We observed a significant reduction in GGT5 expression in two in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease (Aβ1-42-treated hCMEC/D3 and bEnd.3 cells), as well as in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Additionally, injection of APP/PS1 mice with an adeno-associated virus encoding GGT5 enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and mitigated cognitive deficits. Interestingly, increasing GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells reduced levels of both soluble and insoluble amyloid-β in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. This effect may be attributable to inhibition of the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, which is mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B. Our findings demonstrate that GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells is inversely associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and that GGT5 upregulation mitigates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.",Neural regeneration research
40297861,"Relationships among cortical activation, cognition, and blood biomarkers in two types of dementia determined using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.","OBJECTIVE: The most prevalent types of dementia in older adults are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), and they have overlapping clinical symptoms. We aimed to define amounts of cortical activation and to identify indicators of brain function to better distinguish between these types of dementia and aid diagnosis using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentrations in the brains of patients with AD and LBD were detected using fNIRS. Brain function was assessed using a verbal fluency task (VFT). Resting-state and task-state cortical activations were investigated to determine differences between AD and LBD. Blood samples were analyzed to identify relevant biomarkers. The clinical and HbO variables were compared between AD and LBD. Functional connectivity at rest and correlations between HbO variables and blood biomarkers were analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity of the parameters for differentiating the dementias were evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs). RESULTS: This study recruited 28 inpatients with AD and 25 with LBD. Mean HbO concentrations did not significantly differ in the resting state (p > 0.05), whereas functional connectivity significantly differed (t = -3.449, p = 0.001) between the groups. Mean HbO concentrations during the VFT, were significantly lower in the left temporal (p = 0.031), right dorsolateral prefrontal (p = 0.001), and right temporal (p = 0.011) cortices of the AD, than the LBD group. Blood amyloid-β (Aβ)(42) levels were significantly higher in the AD group (p = 0.023), whereas significantly more α-synuclein was expressed in the LBD group (p = 0.012). Correlation analysis of cognition-related blood biomarkers with HbO concentrations associated higher plasma Aβ(42) level with lower HbO concentrations in the right pre-motor and supplementary motor cortex (r = -0.378; p = 0.005) and higher glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in the lower right pars triangularis (r = -0.378; p = 0.006) at rest. Levels of the blood biomarker Aβ significantly and negatively correlated with HbO concentrations in the right temporal cortex (r = -0.329, p = 0.016) during the VFT. The AUC was significantly higher for the combination of multiple fNIRS indicators compared with individual cognitive or blood indicators (AUC = 0.9314). CONCLUSION: The characteristics of HbO measured using fNIRS can help distinguish AD from LBD in older adults.",Frontiers in neurology
40416737,Blood biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in Alzheimer's disease research.,"BACKGROUND: Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be utilized as surrogate endpoints to accelerate therapeutic development for this condition. METHODS: We assessed the association between short-term changes in blood biomarkers and long-term declines in cognitive and brain structure volume measures using the ADNI database, with a focus on amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive participants. In our statistical models, the association was calculated after controlling for age, sex, and other possible confounding covariates. Additionally, outliers were removed before running the statistical models to ensure that the results were robust. RESULTS: A trend association was found between changes in the levels of plasma neurofilament light (NfL) at 12 months and changes in the scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 24 months in Aβ-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. For Aβ-positive dementia patients, a trend association was observed between changes in plasma p-tau181 levels and changes in whole brain and middle temporal volume. CONCLUSION: Increased plasma levels of NfL or p-tau181 blood biomarkers were found to be associated with reduced brain volumes and/or declined cognitive outcomes, suggesting that these blood biomarkers may have a predictive role in AD trials.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40575117,miR-137: A therapeutic candidate or a key molecular regulator in Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder driven by amyloid-β accumulation, tau pathology, and synaptic dysfunction. Recent studies highlight miR-137, a brain-enriched microRNA, as a pivotal regulator of AD pathogenesis. This review synthesizes evidence that miR-137 modulates amyloid-β production, tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation, while also preserving mitochondrial function and mitigating oxidative stress. Notably, circulating miR-137 levels correlate with AD progression, offering promise as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker. Beyond diagnostics, miR-137's ability to target multiple AD-related pathways positions it as a novel therapeutic candidate for neuroprotection. Hence, miR-137 serves as both a biomarker and therapeutic target, offering promising strategies to slow AD progression and improve outcomes. Our bioinformatic analyses further identify miR-137-regulated genes and disrupted networks, underscoring its central role in AD. By bridging molecular mechanisms and clinical potential, miR-137-based strategies could transform AD management, addressing both pathological hallmarks and cognitive decline.

40065919,Blood-based biomarker prescreening with different testing combinations and cutoffs: A simulation study examining efficacy and cost-effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease prevention studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), including plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) or phosphorylated tau (p-tau), combined with apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing, are anticipated to serve as prescreening tools before amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) for recruiting participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention studies. The predictive efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prescreening may vary with different testing combinations, sequences, and cutoff levels. METHODS: We conducted a simulation study utilizing data from our ongoing Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort (J-TRC) onsite study (n = 202) recruited online. We included cognitively unimpaired individuals who had undergone amyloid PET, APOE genotyping, and evaluation of BBBMs (i.e., plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, plasma p-tau217, and plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio). We examined 14 different prescreening models incorporating APOE genotype and/or BBBMs with varied combinations and cutoff levels. Models were evaluated for predictive performance (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value [PPV]) and cost-effectiveness (cost per identified amyloid-positive case) across varied testing costs and the prevalence of amyloid positivity. RESULTS: Applying BBBM prescreening significantly decreased sensitivity and increased specificity and PPV compared to the no-prescreening scenario. Although no single model was superior in all performance metrics, a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity was observed. Generalized linear models (GLMs) simultaneously incorporating plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and p-tau217 showed a balanced efficacy (the best level of improvement in number needed to screen (NNS) but modest worsening in sensitivity) and the best level of cost-effectiveness compared to other models, although there were substantial overlaps in their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The minimum-required PET/BBBM cost ratio to achieve improved cost-effectiveness by employing the prescreening process was negatively associated with the background prevalence of amyloid positivity. DISCUSSION: The choice of prescreening strategy in AD prevention studies/trials should be tailored to specific trial requirements, considering the relative importance of sensitivity versus cost-effectiveness, local testing cost environments, and background population characteristics. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated different models of blood-based biomarker (BBBM) prescreening.Data from Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort Study were used for simulation.BBBM reduced the number needed to screen with positron emission tomography (PET) but decreased the sensitivity.The cost-effectiveness improved with a higher PET/BBBM cost ratio.No single model was optimal for all scenarios.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39317698,Neurofilament light chain associates with IVH and ROP in extremely preterm infants.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is known for indicating adult brain injury, but the role of NfL in extremely preterm infants is less studied. This study examines the relationship between NfL and neurovascular morbidities in these infants. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the Mega Donna Mega trial was conducted on preterm infants <28 weeks gestational age (GA). The study measured NfL levels and proteomic profiles related to the blood-brain barrier in serum from birth to term-equivalent age, investigating the association of NfL with GA, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and blood-brain barrier proteins. RESULTS: Higher NfL levels were seen in the first month in infants with severe IVH and for those born <25 weeks GA (independent of ROP or IVH). Additionally, infants born at 25-27 weeks GA with high NfL were at increased risk of developing severe ROP (independent of IVH). NfL was significantly associated with the proteins CDH5, ITGB1, and JAM-A during the first month. CONCLUSION: NfL surges after birth in extremely preterm infants, particularly in those with severe IVH and ROP, and in the most immature infants regardless of IVH or ROP severity. These findings suggest NfL as a potential predictor of neonatal morbidities, warranting further validation studies. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study shows that higher NfL levels are related to neurovascular morbidities in extremely preterm infants. The degree of immaturity seems important as infants born <25 weeks gestational age exhibited high postnatal serum NfL levels irrespective of neurovascular morbidities. Our findings suggest a potential link between NfL and neurovascular morbidities possibly affected by a more permeable blood-brain barrier.",Pediatric research
39857051,Clinical Utility of an Alzheimer's Disease Blood Test Among Cognitively Impaired Patients: Results from the Quality Improvement PrecivityAD2 (QUIP II) Clinician Survey Study.,"Objective: The objective of this study was to assess clinical decision-making associated with the use of a multi-analyte blood biomarker (BBM) test among patients presenting with signs or symptoms of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Methods: The Quality Improvement PrecivityAD2 (QUIP II) Clinician Survey (NCT06025877) study evaluated the clinical utility of the PrecivityAD2™ blood test in a prospective, single cohort of 203 patients presenting with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other causes of cognitive decline across 12 memory specialists. The PrecivityAD2 blood test (C2N Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO) combines the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and the p-tau217/np-tau217 ratio (%p-tau217) measurements in a statistical algorithm to yield an Amyloid Probability Score 2 (APS2) that informs on the likelihood of brain amyloid plaques. After receiving the BBM test results, clinicians completed surveys on management strategies for each patient. Results: Patients had a median age of 74, 53% were female, and 28% were traditionally under-represented in Black, Hispanic, and Asian groups. The composite primary endpoint, defined as a change in AD diagnostic certainty, drug therapy, or additional brain amyloid evaluation pre- and post-BBM testing, was 75% (p < 0.0001 versus the pre-specified threshold of 20% clinically meaningful change). Anti-AD medication orders decreased among negative APS2 patients and increased among positive APS2 patients (p < 0.0001). Additional brain amyloid testing decreased among negative APS2 patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: This blood biomarker test can help memory specialists guide patients to anti-AD therapies as well as rule out AD to allow for other diagnostic considerations.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)"
39931229,Untargeted urine metabolomics reveals dynamic metabolic differences and key biomarkers across different stages of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often serving as its precursor stage. Early intervention at the MCI stage can significantly delay AD onset. METHODS: This study employed untargeted urine metabolomics, with data obtained from the MetaboLights database (MTBLS8662), combined with orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to examine metabolic differences across different stages of AD progression. A decision tree approach was used to identify key metabolites within significantly enriched pathways. These key metabolites were then utilized to construct and validate an AD progression prediction model. RESULTS: The OPLS-DA model effectively distinguished the metabolic characteristics at different stages. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that Drug metabolism was significantly enriched across all stages, while Retinol metabolism was particularly prominent during the transition stages. Key metabolites such as Theophylline, Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA), and Adenosine showed significant differencesdifferencesin the early stages of the disease, whereas 1,7-Dimethyluric Acid, Cystathionine, and Indole exhibited strong predictive value during the MCI to AD transition. These metabolites play a crucial role in monitoring AD progression. Predictive models based on these metabolites demonstrated excellent classification and prediction capabilities. CONCLUSION: This study systematically analyzed the dynamic metabolic differences during the progression of AD and identified key metabolites and pathways as potential biomarkers for early prediction and intervention. Utilizing urinary metabolomics, the findings provide a theoretical basis for monitoring AD progression and contribute to improving prevention and intervention strategies, thereby potentially delaying disease progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40433169,miRNA mediated mitochondrial function and gene regulation associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are known to regulate gene expression in their target locations thereby contributing to epigenetic mechanisms associated with disease pathologies. Dysregulation of miRNA activity has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), offering insights into potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets. Mitochondrial dysfunction and its associated effects (such as oxidative stress) can be seen in early-onset AD. This review critically examines recent findings on mitochondrial-associated miRNAs-including miR-34a, miR-140, miR-455-3p, and miR-1273g-3p-highlighting their roles in mitochondrial bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and synaptic function. We discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting specific miRNAs to restore mitochondrial health and explore their utility as early biomarkers for AD diagnosis.

39902010,Exploring Potential Mechanisms of Sleep Disorders in Alzheimer's Dementia: A Scoping Review.,"Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is characterized by a progressive decline in behavioral and cognitive functions, with sleep disorders (SDs) increasingly recognized as one of the noncognitive symptoms. Sleep plays a critical role in the brain, supporting learning and memory, regulating synaptic plasticity, and facilitating waste clearance. However, the mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances in AD remain poorly understood. This review aims to explore these mechanisms and their potential relevance for clinicians managing AD. A systematic search was conducted across multiple sources and databases, using keywords such as ""Alzheimer AND sleep disorder"", along with terms related to neurodegeneration and sleep disturbances. Of the 1,511 records identified, 18 were included in the final analysis. The findings highlight several mechanisms linking AD and SDs, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. These mechanisms include (i) shared genetic factors; (ii) disruption of the glymphatic system; (iii) circadian system dysregulation; (iv) neuroinflammation; (v) abnormal functional connectivity between related brain regions; and (vi) atrophy in brain regions involved in memory and sleep. In conclusion, the relationship between AD and SDs is complex and bidirectional. Sleep disturbances not only precede the onset of AD but also worsen as the disease progresses. Sleep may, therefore, serve as a promising biomarker for AD, with targeting sleep disturbances offering a potential early therapeutic strategy in managing AD.",Cureus
39893752,The value of CSF diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in NMOSD and MOGAD in real-life use.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) may be challenging owing to overlapping clinical features with multiple sclerosis (MS) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), particularly in AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD patients. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, specifically glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and albumin quotient (QAlb), to improve diagnostic accuracy in NMOSD. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed CSF samples for biomarkers GFAP, QAlb, neurofilament light, and total-Tau, from patients with AQP4-NMOSD, DNNMOSD, MOGAD, and MS in the Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) was used to identify optimal cut-off levels for discriminating AQP4-NMOSD from the other groups. Logistic regression models assessed the diagnostic power of GFAP and QAlb combined. RESULTS: Patients with AQP4-NMOSD (N = 19) had significantly higher CSF GFAP levels than the others: median 2470 ng/L vs 330 ng/L (p < 0.001). The GFAP cutoff >715 ng/L gave a sensitivity of 81 % and specificity of 92 %. Combining GFAP and QAlb further increased the diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.96). MOGAD patients (N = 29) had the highest CSF lymphocyte counts, with elevated lymphocyte counts correlating with polyphasic MOGAD (R = 0.63; p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: CSF GFAP is a valuable biomarker for distinguishing AQP4-NMOSD from other demyelinating diseases: Combining GFAP with QAlb enhances diagnostic precision.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders
39865820,New Research on Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Continuum.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial pathology, responsible for neurodegenerative disorders which in more than 60% of patients evolve into dementia. Comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology and the development of reliable diagnostic methods have made new and more effective therapies possible. In recent years, in addition to the classic anticholinesterases (AChEs), which can control the clinical symptoms of the disease, compounds able to reduce deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and/or tau (τ) protein aggregates, which are disease-modifying therapeutics (DMTs), have been studied. The results have shown that symptomatic therapy works best when administered in the disease's mild to moderate clinical phase. On the other hand, treatment with DMTs has been found to be more effective in the preclinical stage of AD, when Aβ and τ protein neurofibrillary tangles have not yet been compromised and patients still have a normal quality of life. This innovative approach requires the identification of specific biomarkers predictive of the disease, detectable many years before clinical signs are evident. Biomarkers allow early diagnosis, give indications of the possible development of dementia in the future, and make it possible to study the evolution of the disease. New scenarios, involving different pathways and approaches, could emerge and provide effective therapies to treat the very early stages of the disease and hamper its progression. The specific biomarkers studied so far have been reported here.",Reviews on recent clinical trials
40161995,Multimodal MRI accurately identifies amyloid status in unbalanced cohorts in Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in conjunction with hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the form of neurofibrillary tangles are the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. It is well-known that the identification of individuals with Aβ positivity could enable early diagnosis. In this work, we aim at capturing the Aβ positivity status in an unbalanced cohort enclosing subjects at different disease stages, exploiting the underlying structural and connectivity disease-induced modulations as revealed by structural, functional, and diffusion MRI. Of note, due to the unbalanced cohort, the outcomes may be guided by those factors rather than amyloid accumulation. The partial views provided by each modality are integrated in the model, allowing to take full advantage of their complementarity in encoding the effects of the Aβ accumulation, leading to an accuracy of 0.762 ± 0.04. The specificity of the information brought by each modality is assessed by post hoc explainability analysis (guided backpropagation), highlighting the underlying structural and functional changes. Noteworthy, well-established biomarker key regions related to Aβ deposition could be identified by all modalities, including the hippocampus, thalamus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus, witnessing in favor of the reliability of the method as well as its potential in shedding light on modality-specific possibly unknown Aβ deposition signatures.","Network neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)"
39888421,Imaging biomarkers of cortical neurodegeneration underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.,"PURPOSE: Imaging biomarkers bear great promise for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the ability of three commonly used neuroimaging modalities to detect cortical changes in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD). METHODS: 53 cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN), 32 PD-MCI, and 35 PDD underwent concurrent structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), and [(18)F]FDG PET. We extracted grey matter volumes (sMRI), mean diffusivity (MD, dMRI), and standardized uptake value ratios ([(18)F]FDG PET) for 52 cortical regions included in a neuroanatomical atlas. We assessed group differences using ANCOVA models and further applied a cross-validated machine learning approach to identify the modality-specific brain regions that are most indicative of dementia status and assessed their diagnostic accuracy for group separation using receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS: In sMRI, atrophy of temporal and posterior-parietal areas allowed separating PDD from PD-CN (AUC = 0.77 ± 0.07), but diagnostic accuracy was poor for separating PD-MCI from PD-CN (0.57 ± 0.10). dMRI showed most pronounced diffusivity changes in the medial temporal lobe, which provided excellent diagnostic performance for PDD (AUC = 0.87 ± 0.06), and a more modest but still significant performance for PD-MCI (AUC = 0.71 ± 0.09). Finally, [(18)F]FDG PET revealed pronounced hypometabolism in posterior-occipital regions, which provided the highest diagnostic accuracies for both PDD (AUC = 0.89 ± 0.05) and PD-MCI (AUC = 0.78 ± 0.05). In statistical comparisons, both [(18)F]FDG PET (p < 0.001) and dMRI (p < 0.031) outperformed sMRI for detecting PDD and PD-MCI. CONCLUSION: Among the tested modalities, [(18)F]FDG PET was most accurate for detecting cortical changes associated with cognitive impairment in PD, especially at early stages. Diffusion measurements may represent a promising MRI-based alternative.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging
40529210,Neurobiological and therapeutic landmarks of depression associated with Alzheimer's disease dementia.,"Depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia has become an increasingly recognized public health concern due to its high prevalence and substantial impact on patient outcomes. Despite extensive research having been conducted over the past decades, the precise causal mechanisms and the nature of the relationship between depression and AD dementia remain incompletely understood. This narrative review examines the bidirectional interaction between depression and Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing shared neurobiological pathways, including neurotransmitter dysregulation, neuroinflammation, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and deficits in neuroplasticity. These mechanisms likely contribute to the acceleration of neurodegeneration in AD and the onset or worsening of depressive symptoms. Current therapeutic approaches remain largely nonspecific, with a lack of targeted therapies that address the unique pathophysiological context of depression in AD. While progress has been made, key research gaps remain, particularly in understanding the complex biological interactions between these two conditions. Future research should focus on identifying specific biomarkers and developing personalized treatment strategies tailored to the neurobiological features of both depression and AD. By addressing these neurobiological mechanisms, we can develop more effective and targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing clinical care for this dual pathology.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39856378,Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain in patients with chronic migraine: a multicenter case-control study.,"OBJECTIVE: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (pGFAP) and plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) levels reflect astrocyte activation and neuronal damage, respectively. Whether these phenomena play a role in migraine is unknown. This study aimed to compare pGFAP and pNfL levels in patients with chronic migraine (CM) and age-matched controls and to analyze their relation with clinical features. METHODS: The study evaluated two independent cohorts of patients, including in total 58 CM and 69 controls. pGFAP and pNfL were quantified with single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Demographic and clinical data were collected for each subject; differences in NfL/GFAP levels between CM and controls were evaluated in analyses adjusted for the effect of age and sex; clinical characteristics associated with NfL/GFAP levels were separately evaluated in the two cohorts. RESULTS: In both cohorts, we did not find a significant difference in pGFAP or pNFL levels between CM and matched controls. The study did not find any correlation between pGFAP or pNfL levels and any migraine characteristics (namely presence of migraine aura, attack frequency, migraine intensity, years of disease). CONCLUSIONS: Our negative results support the assumption that migraine represents a benign condition, characterized by transient functional brain alterations and not by the accumulation over time of neuroaxonal damage and/or associated astrocyte activation detectable by neurodegeneration marker proteins.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and

40529444,Advances in gait research related to Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a degenerative condition affecting the nervous system, characterized by the absence of a definitive cause and a lack of a precise therapeutic intervention. Extensive research efforts are being conducted worldwide to enhance early detection methods for AD and to develop medications capable of effectively halting the initiation and progression of the disease during its early stages. Some current detection methods for early diagnosis are expensive and require invasive procedures. More and more evidence shows that gait is related to cognition. A deeper investigation into the intricate interplay between gait and cognition is necessary to elucidate their reciprocal influences and the temporal sequence of these interactions. In the future, it is hoped that with the results of clinical manifestations, neuroimaging, and electrophysiology, simple and objective gait analysis results can be used as an alternative biomarker for cognitive decline to diagnose dementia early. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: This research offers a comprehensive scoping review of the contemporary landscape of clinical gait evaluation. It delineates the pertinent concepts of gait analysis and machine learning in AD and elucidates the intricate interplay between gait patterns and cognitive status. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted within PubMed for all articles published until march 18, 2024, using a set of keywords, including ""machine learning and gait ""and ""gait and Alzheimer."" original articles that met the selection criteria were included. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: A strong correlation exists between autonomous gait and cognitive attributes, necessitating further investigation into the selective interplay between gait and mental factors. Conversely, the gait information of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients can be captured using a 3D gait analysis system. Numerous gait characteristics can be derived from this gait data, and the early identification of AD can be facilitated by applying a graph neural network-based machine learning approach.",Frontiers in neurology

40017567,"Graph Theoretical Measures for Alzheimer's, MCI, and Normal Controls: A Comparative Study Using MRI Data.","BACKGROUND: The Graph theory provides the platform that could be used to model complex brain networks mathematically, and it could play a significant role in the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. PURPOSE: The main aim of our study is to perform a comparative analysis in terms of various graph theoretic measures of structural brain networks. In particular, the paper evaluates graph theoretical measures by first forming graphs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. METHOD: In this paper, we study and evaluate graph theoretical measures using MRI data, namely characteristic path length, global efficiency, strength, and clustering coefficient, in a cohort of normal controls (N = 30), a cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (N = 30), and a cohort of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (N = 30). In our work, MRI data is preprocessed and cortical thickness is extracted for each brain region. The connectivity matrix is obtained, and thus a graph is formed. We have also performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC analyses of all graph theoretical measures to better elucidate and validate the results. RESULTS: It is observed that these measures may be used to differentiate Alzheimer's from normal. In our study, we observed that a very random and disrupted network is obtained in the case of Alzheimer's in comparison with the normal and MCI cases. The other observations in terms of graph theoretic measures are an increase in characteristic path length, a decrease in global efficiency, a decrease in strength, and a reduction in values of the clustering coefficient in the case of Alzheimer's. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that graph theoretical measures and alterations in network topology could be used as quantitative biomarkers of AD.",Annals of neurosciences
38261679,Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Memory loss is a common complaint among older adults, and cognitive decline can present in various ways. It is a part of the normal aging process, subjective cognitive impairment (symptomatic complaints with normal neurocognitive test results), mild cognitive impairment, or dementia. Although mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been used in the literature since the 1960s, it was first fully characterized in 1997 by Petersen and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic. As part of their community aging study, they observed individuals with memory concerns beyond what was expected for their age. They demonstrated memory impairment on objective testing yet did not fulfill the criteria for dementia. MCI was deemed to represent a borderline between normal aging and very early dementia. The earlier criteria for MCI diagnosis were found inadequate when it was realized that not all patients with MCI progressed to dementia and that memory impairment was not the only cognitive domain affected. Thus, a broader definition of MCI was needed. In 2003, the first Key Symposium on MCI was held, leading to the publication of revised core clinical criteria. These criteria included cognitive complaints from the patient or family members, deficits in any cognitive domain and not only memory, preserved overall general function but increasing difficulties in activities of daily life, and no dementia. The concept of MCI traveled outside the realm of research to provide clinicians with a useful diagnosis, often for close monitoring. Further clinical research resulted in the development of novel clinical criteria for providers.  The American Psychiatry Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-V) in 2013 classified MCI as one of the neurocognitive disorders (NCD). It is characterized by a decline in one or more cognitive domains, which is both subjectively and objectively observable. However, this decline does not interfere with the individual's ability to perform daily activities independently. Moreover, the deficits cannot be attributed to delirium or other psychiatric conditions. DSM-V does not propose specific neuropsychology test scores for diagnosing mild NCD. However, it is implied that such scores would help make this diagnosis. After diagnosing the syndrome as mild NCD, the next step is determining the etiology. The 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 11) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018 adopted the definition of mild neurocognitive disorder in alignment with the DSM-V diagnostic criteria. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) convened a work group to discuss the MCI criteria. The group proposed metrics for the distinct definition of MCI due to Alzheimer Disease. The initial criteria were published in 2011 and revised in 2018. The initial criteria closely resemble the core clinical criteria proposed by the 2003 Symposium. The 2018 revision noted that neurobehavioral disturbance may be an important feature of the clinical presentation and that cognitive deficits may result in a mild but noticeable impact on the complex activities of daily living. The NIA-AA also suggested research criteria for MCI due to AD in 2011 to help determine the etiology of MCI established by the core clinical criteria. These included the use of biomarkers to differentiate MCI due to AD from MCI due to other reasons. The biomarkers are not used to define MCI but can be helpful in research settings. The two main helpful biomarkers are amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and neuronal injury. MCI can also be classified based on the type of cognitive domain that is affected. MCI can potentially affect one or more of the following 6 cognitive domains: learning and memory, language, complex attention, executive function, social cognition, and visuospatial function. MCI can be classified as ""amnestic"" or ""non-amnestic"" with deficits in single or multiple cognitive domains. Amnestic MCI presents with predominant memory loss and the risk for progression to Alzheimer's Disease. In non-amnestic MCI, memory is relatively intact, and it is less common than the amnestic type and may progress to non-Alzheimer disease dementia. MCI can be further categorized into 4 subtypes:  In 2009, a comprehensive Neuropsychology classification system was introduced as the dichotomous classification was considered inadequate to represent the heterogeneous nature of MCI. These MCI classes are: : 1. Amnestic - impaired recall and recognition . 2. Mixed - impairments in various domains such as language, executive function, recall and recognition, and visuospatial functioning. 3. Dysexecutive - impairments in attention, executive, and visuospatial functions, but the memory remains intact. . 4. Visuospatial - impairment in only a single measure of visual construction. . The phenotypic classification of MCI with clinical information and laboratory tests can guide the clinician in determining the probable cause of MCI and predicting its course. Patients with dysexecutive MCI (dMCI) are less likely to have Alzheimer - type dementia and more likely to have a stroke.",
40337464,Onset ages of cerebrovascular disease and amyloid and effects on cognition in risk-enriched cohorts.,"The temporal relationship between cerebrovascular disease (V), indicated by white matter hyperintensities, and beta-amyloid (A) in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, prompting speculation about their potential interdependence. Longitudinal data were employed to estimate onset ages and corresponding disease chronicity for A and V (where disease chronicity is calculated as age at measurement minus estimated age of biomarker abnormality onset). In a large, predominantly cognitively unimpaired dataset (n = 877, ages 43-93 years), a V+ threshold was identified, and Sampled Iterative Local Approximation (SILA) was utilized to illustrate the predictable accumulation trajectory of V post-onset. Investigating the temporal association between A and V onset ages and accumulation trajectories in preclinical years, four operationalizations of time were examined across two initially cognitively unimpaired samples (n = 240 primary sample from Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention; n = 123 replication sample from Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center): (i) chronological age, (ii) estimated V+ chronicity, (iii) years since baseline scan, and (iv) estimated A+ chronicity. Results indicated that while both diseases are age-related, their onsets and trajectories are independent of each other. In addition, results indicated that V and A accumulation trajectories were highly predictable relative to onset of positivity for each biomarker. Cognitive decline across multiple cognitive domains was fastest when both V and A were present based on last available amyloid PET and MRI scan, with greater A chronicity being a more salient predictor of cognitive decline in these samples.",Brain communications
40385089,Advancements in deep learning for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using multimodal neuroimaging: challenges and future directions.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder challenging early diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in deep learning algorithms applied to multimodal brain imaging offer promising solutions for improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting disease progression. METHOD: This narrative review synthesizes current literature on deep learning applications in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using multimodal neuroimaging. The review process involved a comprehensive search of relevant databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov), selection of pertinent studies, and critical analysis of findings. We employed a best-evidence approach, prioritizing high-quality studies and identifying consistent patterns across the literature. RESULTS: Deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer-based models, have shown remarkable potential in analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data. These models can effectively process structural and functional imaging modalities, extracting relevant features and patterns associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Integration of multiple imaging modalities has demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. Deep learning models have also shown promise in predictive modeling, identifying potential biomarkers and forecasting disease progression. DISCUSSION: While deep learning approaches show great potential, several challenges remain. Data heterogeneity, small sample sizes, and limited generalizability across diverse populations are significant hurdles. The clinical translation of these models requires careful consideration of interpretability, transparency, and ethical implications. The future of AI in neurodiagnostics for Alzheimer's disease looks promising, with potential applications in personalized treatment strategies.",Frontiers in neuroinformatics
40207046,From genes to drugs: targeting Alzheimer's with circadian insights.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease that presents challenges due to the lack of biomarkers to identify AD. A growing body of evidence highlights the critical role of circadian rhythms in AD. METHODS: The differentially expressed clock genes (DECGs) were identified between AD and ND groups (non-demented controls). Functional enrichment analysis was executed on the DECGs. Candidate diagnostic biomarkers for AD were screened by machine learning. ROC and nomograms were constructed to evaluate candidate biomarkers. In addition, therapeutics targeting predictive biomarkers were screened through the DGIdb website. Finally, the mRNA-miRNA network was constructed. RESULTS: Nine genes were identified through the DECG analysis between the AD and ND groups. Enrichment analysis of nine genes indicated that the pathways were enriched in long-term potentiation and circadian entrainment. Four clock genes (GSTM3, ERC2, PRKCG, and HLA-DMA) of AD were screened using Lasso regression, random forest, SVM, and GMM. The diagnostic performance of four genes was evaluated by the ROC curve. Furthermore, the nomogram indicated that ERC2, PRKCG, and HLA-DMA are good biomarkers in diagnosing AD. Single-gene GSEA indicated that the main enrichment pathways were oxidative phosphorylation, pathways of neurodegeneration-multiple diseases, etc. The results of immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that there were significant differences in 15 immune cell subsets between AD and ND groups. Moreover, 23 drugs targeting HLA-DMA and 8 drugs targeting PRKCG were identified through the DGIdb website. CONCLUSION: We identified three predictive biomarkers for AD associated with clock genes, thus providing promising therapeutic targets for AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40336944,The role of quantitative EEG biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: applications and insights.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the pathological accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, leading to disruptions in synaptic transmission and neural circuit alterations.

Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a computational method for quantifying brain electrical activity, is increasingly applied in AD research. We highlight the application of qEEG biomarkers, including power spectrum analysis (oscillatory activity within frequency bands), functional connectivity (coherent neural couplings) and effective connectivity (directional neural interactions), microstates (brief, stable states of the brain network), and non-linear analyses (e.g., entropy and EEG network analysis). These biomarkers can reflect real-time neural dynamics, making them ideal tools for diagnosis and monitoring the progression AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It has been shown that decreased α power and increased θ power within the qEEG spectrum correlate with enhanced AD severity. Data from microstate analysis have demonstrated significant variations in temporal dynamics in patients with AD. Non-linear measures, such as entropy, have identified marked reductions in neural complexity in AD and MCI patients, indicating that they may serve as early diagnostic markers. Compared to traditional neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), qEEG is known to be cost-effective and facilitates real-time monitoring. Overall, qEEG biomarkers are promising for advancing AD research due to their non-invasive nature, affordability, and ability to capture real-time neural activity. Integrating qEEG with multimodal neuroimaging and clinical profiles may facilitate earlier identification and precision therapies. Future research should focus on standardizing protocols, validating biomarkers across diverse cohorts, and exploring their potential in large-scale clinical trials.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40343304,DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes in late onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic systemic inflammation is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and has measurable effects on blood cells. There is increasing interest in non-invasive diagnostic tools that use blood-based biomarkers for AD, such as DNA methylation. Notably, DNA methylation changes in blood are also linked to systemic inflammation. The evaluation of DNA methylation profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes as potential biomarkers for AD is promising. OBJECTIVE: To determine DNA methylation patterns in blood for AD, and to explore specific blood CpG sites that act as surrogates for brain-tissue methylation. METHODS: DNA methylation data from peripheral blood leukocytes of AD patients and controls were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE59685 and GSE53740). Differential methylation analysis was performed for individual CpGs Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions with multiple probes (DMRs) and the intersection analysis of DMPs and DMRs was conducted. Functional enrichment analysis highlights relevant biological processes. Furthermore, previously validated specific CpGs used as surrogate of brain tissue were explored. RESULTS: DNA methylation patterns included BTBD3, PGPEP1L, DUSP29, and MIB2 top genes ordered by statistical significance were found in the intersection of DMP and DMR. Differential methylation analyses revealed differentially methylated genes including HOXA-AS3, HOXA6, CACNA1A, KMT5A, MIDEAS, FAM234A, and KATNBL1P6. Gene enrichment analysis showed immune processes and intracellular signaling disruptions. Surrogate genes from brain found differentially methylated were PCDHGB1-3 and PCDHGA1-6. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood leukocytes as potential biomarkers for AD. These findings offer insights into epigenetic mechanisms associated with systemic peripheral inflammation in AD.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
40370752,"Association of low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio with cognition, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain structure.","BACKGROUND: The relationship between the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) ratio, an indicator of lipid metabolism and assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine the association of LDL/HDL ratio and the risk of AD. Multiple linear regression and mixed effects models used to assess associations between LDL/HDL and cognitive function, AD pathology, and brain structure. Mediation analyses examined AD pathology's potential mediating role between the LDL/HDL ratio and cognition. RESULTS: Higher LDL/HDL ratio correlated with lower AD risk (HR 0.644 [0.431, 0.962]). In the linear regression analyses, the LDL/HDL ratio were positively associated with cognition. Longitudinally, the LDL/HDL ratio also positively with cognitive measures. Besides, higher LDL/HDL ratio were associated Aβ(42) and decreased Tau, pTau, Tau/Aβ(42), pTau/Aβ(42), and pTau/Tau. The LDL/HDL ratio was positively associated with brain structures such as hippocampal volume. Mediation analyses revealed AD pathology mediated the association between LDL/HDL ratio and cognition. CONCLUSION: The LDL/HDL ratio is associated with AD risk, cognition, AD biomarkers and brain structure and can affect cognition by AD biomarkers.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience

40190314,Peripheral blood cell profile and monocyte-high-density lipoprotein ratio in Alzheimer's disease: a hospital-based case-control study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive decline in memory and cognitive abilities. The monocyte/HDL-C ratio (MHR) has emerged as a new marker of inflammation in recent years. The purpose of this research was to examine MHR alterations in AD and to assess its feasibility as a straightforward and easily computable biomarker for evaluating the severity of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted with 101 patients with AD and 81 age and sex-matched controls from the hospital records. AD was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. The hospital's electronic patient record data between September 2021 and April 2022 were screened. RESULTS: Individuals diagnosed as having AD were classified into three subgroups based on the progression of the disease: mild, moderate, and severe. MHR was higher in the moderate and severe dementia subgroups compared with the controls according to subgroup analysis (p = 0.013). An increase in MHR was found in patients with AD. The multivariate logistic regression analysis model revealed that a one-unit increase in MHR resulted in a 1.081-fold increase in the risk of AD (OR = 1.081, 95% CI: [1.005-1.162]; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: High MHR values could not be used as a diagnostic test for AD. Instead, because it negatively correlates with MMSE, it could be a good index reflecting increased AD risk and disease severity.",Archives of medical science : AMS
39845024,Exploring the Kidney-Brain Crosstalk: Biomarkers for Early Detection of Kidney Injury-Related Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of ""kidney-brain crosstalk"" has stimulated scholarly inquiry into the correlations between kidney injury (KI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, the precise interactions and shared mechanisms between KI and AD have yet to be fully investigated. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the link between KI and AD, with a specific focus on identifying diagnostic biomarkers for KI-related AD. METHODS: The first step of the present study was to use Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the link between KI and AD, followed by verification of in vivo and in vitro experiments. Subsequently, bioinformatics and machine learning techniques were used to identify biomarkers for KI-associated ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in AD, which were validated in following experiments. Moreover, the relationship between hub biomarkers and immune infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT, and the potential drugs or small molecules associated with the core biomarkers were identified via the DGIdb database. RESULTS: MR analysis showed that KI may be a risk factor for AD. Experiments showed that the combination of D-galactose and aluminum chloride was found to induce both KI and AD, with ferroptosis emerging as a bridge to facilitate crosstalk between KI and AD. Besides, we identified EGFR and RELA have significant diagnostic value. These biomarkers are associated with NK_cells_resting and B_cells_memory and could be targeted for intervention in KI-related AD by treating gefitinib and plumbagin. CONCLUSION: Our study elucidates that ferroptosis may be an important pathway for kidney-brain crosstalk. Notably, gefitinib and plumbagin may be therapeutic candidates for intervening in KI-associated AD by targeting EGFR and RELA.",Journal of inflammation research
39886325,"Clinical and neuropathological associations of plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40), p-tau217 and neurofilament light in sporadic frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders.","INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta(42)/amyloid beta(40) (Aβ(42)/Aβ(40)) and phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) identify individuals with primary Alzheimer's disease (AD). They may detect AD co-pathology in the setting of other primary neurodegenerative diseases, but this has not been systematically studied. METHODS: We compared the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological associations of plasma Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) (mass spectrometry), p-tau217 (electrochemiluminescence), and neurofilament light ([NfL], single molecule array [Simoa]), as markers of AD co-pathology, in a sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cohort (n = 620). RESULTS: Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) showed no clinicopathological associations. High p-tau217 was present in amnestic dementia (AmD) presumed to be due to FTD, logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and APOEε4 carriers, and correlated with worse baseline and longitudinal clinical scores, lower hippocampal volumes, and more severe AD co-pathology (Braak Stage). NfL was elevated in all FTD phenotypes, and correlated with clinical scores and frontotemporal brain volumes. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 has clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological correlates in sporadic FTD and may identify FTD cases with AD co-pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) features could be identified with plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).Plasma p-tau217 is a better discriminator of AD co-pathology and AD-associated features in FTLD than plasma amyloid beta(42)/amyloid beta(40) (Aβ(42)/Aβ(40)) and neurofilament light (NfL).In FTLD, plasma p-tau217, but not Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) or neurofilament light, has phenotypical, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging correlates suggestive of AD co-pathology.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40520536,Integrative single-cell and cell-free plasma RNA transcriptomics identifies biomarkers for early non-invasive AD screening.,"INTRODUCTION: Data-driven omics approaches have rapidly advanced our understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, limited by the unavailability of brain tissue, there is an urgent need for a non-invasive tool to detect alterations in the AD brain. Cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which crosses the blood-brain barrier, could reflect AD brain pathology and serve as a diagnostic biomarker. METHODS: Here, we integrated plasma-derived cfRNA-seq data from 337 samples (172 AD patients and 165 age-matched controls) with brain-derived single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from 88 samples (46 AD patients and 42 controls) to explore the potential of cfRNA profiling for AD diagnosis. A systematic comparative analysis of cfRNA and brain scRNA-seq datasets was conducted to identify dysregulated genes linked to AD pathology. Machine learning models-including support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression-were trained using cfRNA expression patterns of the identified gene set to predict AD diagnosis and classify disease progression stages. Model performance was rigorously evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with robustness assessed through cross-validation and independent validation cohorts. RESULTS: Notably, we identified 34 dysregulated genes with consistent expression changes in both cfRNA and scRNA-seq. Machine learning models based on the cfRNA expression patterns of these 34 genes can accurately predict AD patients (the highest AUC = 89%) and effectively distinguish patients at early stage of AD. Furthermore, classifiers developed based on the expression of 34 genes in brain transcriptome data demonstrated robust predictive performance for assessing the risk of AD in the population (the highest AUC = 94%). DISCUSSION: This multi-omics approach overcomes limitations of invasive brain biomarkers and noisy blood-based signatures. The 34-gene panel provides non-invasive molecular insights into AD pathogenesis and early screening. While cfRNA stability challenges clinical translation, our framework highlights the potential for precision diagnostics and personalized therapeutic monitoring in AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience

39851360,"LiveDrive AI: A Pilot Study of a Machine Learning-Powered Diagnostic System for Real-Time, Non-Invasive Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant global health issue, affecting over 55 million individuals worldwide, with a progressive impact on cognitive and functional abilities. Early detection, particularly of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as an indicator of potential AD onset, is crucial yet challenging, given the limitations of current diagnostic biomarkers and the need for non-invasive, accessible tools. This study aims to address these gaps by exploring driving performance as a novel, non-invasive biomarker for MCI detection. Using the LiveDrive AI system, equipped with multimodal sensing (MMS) technology and a driving performance assessment strategy, the proposed work analyzes the predictive capacity of driving patterns in indicating cognitive decline. Machine learning models, trained on an expert-annotated in-house dataset, were employed to detect MCI status from driving performance. Key findings demonstrate the feasibility of using nuanced driving features, such as velocity and acceleration during turning, as indicators of cognitive decline. This approach holds promise for integration into smartphone or car applications, enabling real-time, continuous cognitive health monitoring. The implications of this work suggest a transformative step towards scalable, real-world solutions for early AD diagnosis, with the potential to improve patient outcomes and disease management.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)"
40453757,Regulatory mechanism of circular RNAs in brain and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Recent advancements in sequencing technology have allowed scientists to study the function and expression of different non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are increasingly recognized as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. These classes of ncRNAs are closed loops that are made from alternative mRNA splicing and can be found in large quantities with their evolutionarily conserved features across different species. These circRNAs can be derived from both coding and non-coding transcript and regulate cellular proteins and the expression of linear mRNA transcripts via their ability to act as miRNA sponges at various levels. Different circRNAs can affect the neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), via altering a variety of methods. However, there is still limited knowledge about circRNAs in brain cells. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the role of circRNAs in the brain to reveal a new potential therapeutic target and open the door to novel therapies and improved management of brain and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience
39851356,Biomarker Investigation Using Multiple Brain Measures from MRI Through Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Alzheimer's Disease Classification.,"As the leading cause of dementia worldwide, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has prompted significant interest in developing Deep Learning (DL) approaches for its classification. However, it currently remains unclear whether these models rely on established biological indicators. This work compares a novel DL model using structural connectivity (namely, BC-GCN-SE adapted from functional connectivity tasks) with an established model using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (namely, ResNet18). Unlike most studies primarily focusing on performance, our work places explainability at the forefront. Specifically, we define a novel Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) metric, based on gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Its aim is quantitatively measuring how effectively these models fare against established AD biomarkers in their decision-making. The XAI assessment was conducted across 132 brain parcels. Results were compared to AD-relevant regions to measure adherence to domain knowledge. Then, differences in explainability patterns between the two models were assessed to explore the insights offered by each piece of data (i.e., MRI vs. connectivity). Classification performance was satisfactory in terms of both the median true positive (ResNet18: 0.817, BC-GCN-SE: 0.703) and true negative rates (ResNet18: 0.816; BC-GCN-SE: 0.738). Statistical tests (p < 0.05) and ranking of the 15% most relevant parcels revealed the involvement of target areas: the medial temporal lobe for ResNet18 and the default mode network for BC-GCN-SE. Additionally, our findings suggest that different imaging modalities provide complementary information to DL models. This lays the foundation for bioengineering advancements in developing more comprehensive and trustworthy DL models, potentially enhancing their applicability as diagnostic support tools for neurodegenerative diseases.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)"
40534727,A new method for community-based intelligent screening of early Alzheimer's disease populations based on digital biomarkers of the writing process.,"BACKGROUND: In response to the shortcomings of the current Alzheimer's disease (AD) early populations assessment, which is based on neuropsychological scales with high subjectivity, low accuracy of repeated measurements, tedious process and dependence on physicians, it was found that digital biomarkers based on the writing process can effectively characterize the cognitive deficits of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. METHODS: This study designed a digital writing assessment paradigm, extracted dynamic handwriting and image data during the paradigm assessment process, and analyzed digital biomarkers of the writing process to assess subjects' cognitive functions. A total of 72 subjects, including 34 health controls (HC) and 38 MCI due to AD, were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: Their combined screening efficacy of digital biomarkers based on the MCI writing process due to AD populations having an area under curve (AUC) of 0.918, and a confidence interval (CI) of 0.854-0.982, was higher than the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (AUC = 0.859, CI = 0.772-0.947) and the Mini-mental State Examination Scale (AUC = 0.783, CI = 0.678-0.888).

Due to new therapeutic advancements that significantly extend the lifespan, there may be an increased prevalence of AD in elderly MS patients. Objective: Building on a previous review on MS-AD coexistence, this review not only aimed to broaden the pool of literature searched, but also investigated possible mechanistic links between clinical markers for MS and AD. Methods: We searched for newly reported cases of coexisting MS and AD in PubMed, Clinical Key, BioMed Central, and Europe PubMed Central databases; and identified 101 new cases in addition to the previously reported 24 cases by Luczynski et al. (2019). The resulting 125 comorbid cases necessitated an evaluation of literature on the pathogenesis of MS and AD. Results: This review highlights many overlaps between AD and MS (for instance, the immune cell dysfunction, glymphatic dysfunction, genetics, environmental factors, and others). We critically evaluated clinical and laboratory metrics used to identify AD in MS patients (e.g., MRI, amyloid-β and tau protein identification, miRNA biomarker evaluation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, vitamin levels, gut microbiota etc.). Conclusions: Future research should refine these diagnostic criteria and focus on enhancing screening and detection methods for AD in MS patients. Furthermore, one should also investigate the primary causes of the increased comorbidity between AD and MS.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
40182696,Cerebrospinal fluid Visinin-like protein-1 was associated with the relationship of body mass index with Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognition in non-demented elderly.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship and mechanisms between body mass index (BMI) and cognition are complex and inconclusive. Additionally, the role of neuronal calcium dysfunction, reflected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), in the mechanisms linked with BMI and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between CSF VILIP-1, BMI, and AD pathologies in non-demented elderly at early stages of AD. METHODS: Baseline CSF AD core biomarkers (amyloid-β(42) [Aβ(42)], phosphorylated tau [P-tau], and total tau [T-tau]) were measured for 1201 non-demented participants, selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, among whom 128 had measurements of CSF VILIP-1. Multivariate linear regression, causal mediation analyses, and linear mixed effects models were conducted to detect these associations. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 72.6. CSF VILIP-1 was decreased in A+/TN- (A-positive/T- and N- negative) group and elevated in A-/TN + (A-negative/T- or N-positive) and A+/TN + groups, as compared with A-/TN- group. In total participants, BMI was negatively related to CSF P-tau, T-tau, P-tau/Aβ(42) and T-tau/Aβ(42). Noticeable associations were also presented between CSF VILIP-1 and AD core biomarkers, but not with Aβ(42) after stratification by A/T/N scheme. Furthermore, the influences of BMI on CSF tau pathology were mediated by CSF VILIP-1. Higher baseline CSF VILIP-1 correspond to faster longitudinal cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that CSF VILIP-1 changed dynamically and might be a key mediator in the associations between BMI and tau pathology, providing new insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying BMI-related cognitive deficits in non-demented elderly.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
39981356,Investigating the neuroprotective effects of Dracocephalum moldavica extract and its effect on metabolomic profile of rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive condition marked by multiple underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the investigation of natural products that can target multiple pathways presents a potential gate for the understanding and management of AD. This study aimed to assess the neuroprotective effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of Dracocephalum moldavica (DM) on cognitive impairment, biomarker changes, and putative metabolic pathways in a rat model of AD induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). The DM extract was standardized and quantified based on examining total phenolic, total flavonoid, rosmarinic acid, and quercetin contents using colorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The antioxidant potential of the extract was evaluated by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and nitric oxide radical scavenging assays. Male Wistar rats were injected with STZ (3 mg/kg, single dose, bilateral ICV) to induce a sporadic AD (sAD) model. Following model induction, rats were orally administered with DM extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day) or donepezil (5 mg/kg/day) for 21 days. Cognitive function was assessed using the radial arm water maze behavioral test. The histopathological evaluations were conducted in the cortex and hippocampus regions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to assess metabolite changes in various brain regions. DM extract significantly attenuated cognitive dysfunction induced by ICV-STZ according to behavioral and histopathological investigations. Thirty-two discriminating metabolites related to the amino acid metabolism; the glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid/glutamine cycle; nucleotide metabolism; lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, ceramides, phosphatidylserines, and prostaglandins), and glucose metabolic pathways were identified in the brains of rats with sAD simultaneously for the first time in this model. Polyphenols in DM extract may contribute to the regulation of these pathways. After treatment with DM extract, 10 metabolites from the 32 identified ones were altered in the brain tissue of a rat model of sAD, most commonly at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of DM by upregulation/downregulation of various pathophysiological biomarkers such as adenine, glycerophosphoglycerol, inosine, prostaglandins, and sphingomyelin induced by ICV-STZ in sAD. These findings are consistent with cognitive behavioral results and histopathological outcomes.",Heliyon
40520530,Blood essential trace elements and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in midlife.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, impacting millions globally. Essential trace elements are implicated in key age-related physiologic processes but have not been fully examined with respect to AD etiology. This study investigates associations between serum levels of essential trace elements (manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, and molybdenum) and AD biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, p-tau181, and total tau) in midlife women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 194 midlife women (median age = 53.3 years) from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, Michigan site. Serum levels of trace elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and AD biomarkers were quantified using single molecule array assays. Multivariable linear regression models assessed potential associations and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used to account for complex co-exposures and non-linear relationships. RESULTS: In the multivariable linear regression models, a doubling of serum molybdenum level was associated with 9.4% higher Aβ42/40 ratio (95% CI: 0.8, 18.6%; p = 0.03), and a doubling of serum cobalt level with 17.5% higher p-tau181 level (95% CI: 3.1, 33.8%; p = 0.02). Copper showed an inverse association with the Aβ42/40 ratio, while zinc was positively associated with the Aβ42/40 ratio, though these associations were marginally significant. BKMR analysis confirmed these associations. CONCLUSION: This study identified statistically significant associations of serum molybdenum and cobalt levels with AD biomarkers, suggesting a potential protective effect of molybdenum against Aβ aggregation and exacerbation of pathologic tau phosphorylation by cobalt. These findings underscore the need for further longitudinal studies to explore the role of essential trace elements in AD pathogenesis.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39861162,Investigating the Therapeutic Mechanisms of Total Saikosaponins in Alzheimer's Disease: A Metabolomic and Proteomic Approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly, yet effective treatments remain elusive. Total saikosaponins (TSS), the primary bioactive components in Bupleurum chinense, have shown promising therapeutic effects against AD in previous studies. Methods: To delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic role of TSS in AD, we investigated its neuroprotective effects and associated molecular mechanisms in APP/PS1 mice. Further, we employed metabolomic and proteomic analyses, with a focus on the potential protein-level changes induced by TSS, particularly those related to metabolite accumulation in the brain. Results: Our results showed that lysophosphatidylcholine, adenosine, and sphingomyelin in plasma might serve as potential biomarkers. Compared to the control group, AD mice exhibited significantly increased expression of proteins related to neuroinflammatory pathways, whereas proteins involved in cAMP signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, and synaptic plasticity pathways were significantly downregulated. Notably, these signaling pathways were partially reversed in APP/PS1 mice following TSS administration. Behavioral tests demonstrated that TSS effectively improved the learning and memory functions of mice. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that TSS ameliorate cognitive decline through regulating neuroinflammatory pathways, cAMP and cGMP signaling, and synaptic plasticity pathways, providing insights into its therapeutic potential in AD.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)"
39820537,Association of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration with gait performance in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Declining gait performance is seen in aging individuals, due to neural and systemic factors. Plasma biomarkers provide an accessible way to assess evolving brain changes; non-specific neurodegeneration (NfL, GFAP) or evolving Alzheimer's disease (Aβ 42/40 ratio, P-Tau181). METHODS: In a population-based cohort of older adults, we evaluate the hypothesis that plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease pathology are associated with worse gait performance. A sample of 2641 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants with measurements of plasma biomarkers and gait parameters was analyzed in this cross-sectional study. Linear regression models using plasma biomarkers as predictors of gait parameters and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and cognitive diagnosis were evaluated. RESULTS: In this study multiple statistically significant relationships are observed for GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 with gait parameters. Each standard deviation increase in GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 is associated with a reduction in velocity of 2.100 (95% CI: -3.004, -1.196; p = 5.4 × 10(-6)), 4.400 (-5.292, -3.507; p = 9.5 × 10(-22)), and 2.617 (-3.414, -1.819; p = 1.5 × 10(-10)) cm/sec, respectively. Overall, NfL has the strongest associations with poor gait performance. Models with age interactions show that the strength of associations between the plasma biomarkers and the gait parameters became stronger with increasing age.

CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease pathology are not only markers of cognitive decline but also indicate motor decline in the aging population.",Communications medicine
39822295,"Plasma biomarkers of amyloid, tau, astrogliosis, and axonal injury in a mixed memory clinic cohort.","INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that blood biomarkers can differentiate dementia disorders. However, the diagnosis of dementia still relies primarily on cerebrospinal fluid and imaging modalities. The new disease-modifying treatments call for more widely applicable biomarkers. METHODS: Plasma samples (n = 250) from two mixed memory clinic were included. Participants were divided into amyloid beta positives (Aβ+) and Aβ negatives (Aβ-). Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181, p-tau231, Aβ1-42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured by single molecule array. RESULTS: Significant differences were found among cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD, and nearly all of the biomarkers were able to predict amyloid status. When combining p-tau181 and p-tau231 they predicted Aβ positivity with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75, and when combining all biomarkers an AUC of 0.86 was found. DISCUSSION: This study supports previous findings on plasma biomarkers, even when investigated in a typical clinical setting in a consecutive, heterogeneous, mixed memory clinic. HIGHLIGHTS: This study investigated seven plasma biomarkers in a mixed memory clinic, regardless of amyloid co-pathology or atypical phenotypes.These findings support previous promising results on plasma biomarkers, even when investigated in a heterogeneous population.The combination of phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 and p-231 performed only slightly worse than a panel of multiple biomarkers, aligning with previous studies.Plasma biomarkers show potential for future applications in primary care, treatment monitoring, and trial selection.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40503330,Brain MRI signatures across sex and CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative effects is not fully understood. This study investigates neurodegeneration patterns across CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarker groups, the association of brain volumes with CSF amyloid and tau status and sex differences in these relationships in a clinical neurology sample. MRI and CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers data were analysed in 306 patients of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system aged 50+ (mean age = 68.4 ± 8.8 years; 43.1% female), who had lumbar punctures within 1 year of clinical MRI scans. We first analysed neurodegeneration patterns across four biomarker groups: 60 controls (A-T-&CU; amyloid negative, tau negative, cognitively unimpaired), 25 A+T- (amyloid positive, tau negative), 121 A+T+ (amyloid positive, tau positive) and 100 other dementia (A-T-&CI; amyloid negative, tau negative, cognitively impaired). Second, we examined volumetric associations with amyloid (amyloid positive, tau negative versus control) and tau in the presence of amyloid (amyloid positive, tau positive versus amyloid positive, tau negative) across 52 brain areas. Third, we examined sex differences in these relationships. Finally, we validated core analyses across three independent datasets-NACC (National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center), ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and EPAD (European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia)-totalling 3137 participants, and performed meta-analyses to obtain more robust estimates. We observed distinct neurodegeneration patterns across biomarker groups, with disrupted connectivity (brain volume covariance networks) in amyloid positive and other dementia groups, while amyloid and tau negative, cognitively unimpaired controls exhibited the most connected network. Amyloid was associated with subcortical, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy, with consistent association observations in the thalamus and amygdala across all four datasets. Tau in the presence of amyloid demonstrated general brain shrinkage through enlargement of extracerebral CSF, alongside unexpected ventricle shrinkages. Sex-based analyses revealed that A+T+ (amyloid positive, tau positive) had lower sex differences in connectivity patterns compared with other groups. Sex differences were also noted in amyloid-related ventricular volume changes. This study reveals how amyloid and tau affect brain connectivity and volume across sex and CSF biomarker groups, emphasizing global brain changes and sex differences. By leveraging automated pipelines and advanced MRI and biomarker analyses, we extracted meaningful and replicable findings from heterogeneous clinical samples from real-world data. The meta-analyses across four datasets enhance the generalizability of our results.",Brain communications
39886320,Impact of sleep disruptions on gray matter structural covariance networks across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"BACKGROUND: This study explores the impact of sleep disturbances on gray matter structural covariance networks (SCNs) across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. METHODS: Amyloid-negative participants served as controls, whereas amyloid positive (A+) individuals were categorized into six groups based on cognitive status and sleep quality. SCNs for the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) were derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. RESULTS: In the DMN, increased structural associations were observed in cognitive unimpaired (CU) A+ and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups regardless of sleep quality, whereas AD with poor sleep (PS) showed a decrease and AD with normal sleep (NS) an increase. For the ECN, AD-NS showed increased and AD-PS showed reduced associations. In the SN, reduced associations were observed in CU A+ NS and MCI-NS, whereas AD-NS displayed increased associations; only AD-PS had decreased associations. CONCLUSION: Distinct SCN damage patterns between normal and poor sleepers provide insights into sleep disturbances in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We delineated distinct patterns of structural covariance networks (SCN) impairment across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, uncovering significant disparities between individuals with normal sleep architecture and those afflicted by sleep disturbances.These observations underscore the pivotal importance of addressing sleep disruptions in AD therapeutics, providing a refined understanding of their detrimental impact on brain networks implicated in the disease.Our investigation epitomizes methodological precision by constructing an AD continuum using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to minimize diagnostic heterogeneity, further enhanced by a substantial cohort size that bolsters the robustness and generalizability of our findings.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40151623,Sleep architecture in Alzheimer's disease continuum: The deep sleep question.,"As sleep appears to be closely related to cognitive status, we aimed to explore the association between the percentage of deep sleep, cognitive state, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker amyloid-beta 42 in non-demented individuals. In this cross-sectional study, 90 non-demented participants from the Aiginition Longitudinal Biomarker Investigation of Neurodegeneration cohort underwent a one-night WatchPAT sleep evaluation. Participants were categorized by cognitive status (patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or cognitively normal [CN] individuals) and CSF Aβ42 status (Aβ42 ≤ 1,030 pg/mL [A+] or Ab42 > 1,030 pg/mL [A-]). After controlling for age, sex, and years of education, a significant inverse association was found between the percentage of deep sleep and the odds of being classified as MCI compared to CN (OR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.76-0.97], p = 0.012). However, a non-significant trend for an inverse association between the percentage of deep sleep and the odds of being classified as A+ was observed (OR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.84-1.01], p = 0.092). This study demonstrates a significant link between deep sleep and MCI. Although more longitudinal studies are needed, deep sleep could potentially serve as a novel biomarker of cognitive decline and an intervention target for dementia prevention.",Open life sciences
39846055,A 3D decoupling Alzheimer's disease prediction network based on structural MRI.,"PURPOSE: This paper aims to develop a three-dimensional (3D) Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction method, thereby bettering current predictive methods, which struggle to fully harness the potential of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. METHODS: Traditional convolutional neural networks encounter pressing difficulties in accurately focusing on the AD lesion structure. To address this issue, a 3D decoupling, self-attention network for AD prediction is proposed. Firstly, a multi-scale decoupling block is designed to enhance the network's ability to extract fine-grained features by segregating convolutional channels. Subsequently, a self-attention block is constructed to extract and adaptively fuse features from three directions (sagittal, coronal and axial), so that more attention is geared towards brain lesion areas. Finally, a clustering loss function is introduced and combined with the cross-entropy loss to form a joint loss function for enhancing the network's ability to discriminate between different sample types. RESULTS: The accuracy of our model is 0.985 for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 0.963 for the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) dataset, both of which are higher than the classification accuracy of similar tasks in this category. This demonstrates that our model can accurately distinguish between normal control (NC) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as between stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) and progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI). CONCLUSION: The proposed AD prediction network exhibits competitive performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed model successfully addresses the challenges of dealing with 3D sMRI image data and the limitations stemming from inadequate information in 2D sections, advancing the utility of predictive methods for AD diagnosis and treatment.",Health information science and systems
40356629,Frontiers and hotspot evolution in research on Alzheimer's disease and hypertension: a bibliometric analysis from 2004 to 2023.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that imposes a heavy burden on patients and their families. Hypertension is an important risk factor for AD, but the specific mechanism of its impact is still unclear. This study thus aimed to analyze the relationship and trend changes between AD and hypertension through bibliometric methods. METHODS: Literature on AD and hypertension was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database between 2004 and 2023. Data regarding countries, institutions, authors and journals were sourced from WoSCC. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used for data visualization, including author collaboration, timelines view of references, reference bursts and overlay visualization maps of keywords. Excel 2018 software was used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,833 publications were ultimately included. From 2004 to 2023, the number of publications per year basically showed an increasing trend. The United States (United States) not only had the largest output of publications and the highest H-index but also had the seven highest frequencies of publication institutions. Kehoe, Patrick ranked first with the most articles among 9,330 authors. The journal with the most published articles was the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. Reference analysis revealed a hotspot in the exploration of the pathophysiological association between AD and hypertension. Second, the treatment effects and potential risks of antihypertensive drugs (AHDs) on AD are also the focus of research. Researchers have carried out a series of studies ranging from basic research to clinical research on AHDs for the treatment of AD. Finally, personalized treatment strategies will also become one of the hotspots of future research. Controlling hypertension through lifestyle changes and medication interventions in AD patients is a promising strategy. The analysis of keywords revealed that ""amyloid deposition,"" ""preeclampsia,"" ""Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" and ""biomarkers"" have been research hotspots in recent years. CONCLUSION: By analyzing the references and keywords, we summarized the hot topics and research trends in this field. These findings provide useful information for researchers to explore the relationship between hypertension and AD further, with the hope of providing more effective treatments for AD patients to delay disease progression and improve quality of life.",Frontiers in neurology
39995599,Anti-amyloid treatments: Why we think they are worth it.,"Years of experience watching our patients progressively decline and die from complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has strongly motivated us to provide newly approved anti-amyloid treatments to appropriate patients. Following detailed and personalized discussions of the potential risks and benefits of these treatments with patients and their families, almost 300 patients at our clinic have chosen to receive lecanemab infusions. We have found the frequency and severity of complications, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), to be manageable and as expected based on clinical trials. While the longer-term benefits of these treatments are not yet clear, our patients and their families are accepting of even a modest slowing of disease progression. We have experienced the complexities, burdens, costs, and major logistical challenges associated with the treatment of AD with anti-amyloid treatments. However, we also understand that for some of our current patients with early symptomatic AD, anti-amyloid treatments are their best option for fighting this devastating disease, and we find it worthwhile to provide these treatments to our patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Many of our former patients have died from complications of AD.Our clinic now has nearly 300 patients receiving anti-amyloid treatments.We have found the complications of anti-amyloid treatments to be manageable.Despite the challenges, we find anti-amyloid treatments worthwhile.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39859053,Functional and Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Cognitive Tests and Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain Levels.,"Background and Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. The disease can manifest and progress with both physical and cognitive symptoms, affecting the patient's daily activities. The aim of our study was to investigate the correlation between functional status, cognitive functions, and neurofilament light chain levels in plasma in MS patients. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, MS patients with a relapsing-remitting course (according to McDonald's criteria, 2017) (n = 42) from Riga East University Hospital and a control group (n = 42) were included. In the MS group, the functional status was determined using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and neurofilament light chain levels in plasma (pNfL) were detected using single molecule array (Simoa) technology. The symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), brief visuospatial memory test-revised (BVMT-R), and the nine-hole peg test (9-HPT) were performed on the MS and control groups, dividing the groups by education level. Results: On the SDMT spreading speed, the MS group performed worse than the control group. The median score for the control group was 94.0, and for the MS group, it was 81.3. Slower performance on the SDMT also correlated with a higher EDSS in the MS group. Cognitive processing speed and memory were better in the control group and among individuals with higher education in both groups. For the BVMT-R, we found no difference between the two groups; both groups were able to learn the task equally well, but we found a weak correlation between age and learning in both groups, which could be related to the normal aging process. Execution reaction speed on the 9-HPT with the dominant hand was slower in the MS group (24.1 s) than in the control group (19.4 s). In the MS group, we observed a trend between SDMT performance and pNfL levels: higher pNfL levels were found in individuals who performed more slowly on the SDMT. Conclusions: Cognitive and fine motor dysfunction correlates with neurological impairment and plasma neurofilament light chain levels in MS patients.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"
39867392,Tau Burden is Best Captured by Magnitude and Extent: Tau-MaX as a Measure of Global Tau.,"Tau exhibits change in both spatial extent and density of pathology along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum with each aspect contributing to the overall burden of pathological tau. Nevertheless, studies using Tau PET have measured either magnitude using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) or extent using number of Tau+ regions. We hypothesized that combining these two dimensions into a single measure of Magnitude and eXtent, Tau-MaX, would provide improved quantification of global tau burden as well as allowing for a region-agnostic measure of global tau burden that does not require a pre-specified region of interest (ROI) or meta-ROI. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed (18)F-flortaucipir PET scans from local and national consortium data (n=1077 participants total) and used Gaussian-mixture models for data from 64 brain regions, to define both tau positivity and magnitude. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal change in Tau-MaX across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum and compared the association of Tau-MaX, magnitude, and extent with plasma p-tau(217) and global cognition. We also compared Tau-MaX using a global, region-agnostic approach to temporal lobe or Braak stage meta-ROIs. Whereas separate assessments of extent and magnitude across the disease spectrum found earlier increases in Tau spatial extent and later increases in magnitude, Tau-MaX was able to dynamically capture this shift demonstrating a stronger association with extent in the preclinical stage and a stronger association with magnitude in clinical stages. Global Tau-MaX differed between disease stages cross-sectionally and changed over time in all stages of disease. Further, Tau-MaX significantly improved associations with plasma p-tau(217) and global cognition compared to magnitude or extent alone. Finally, global measures of Tau-MaX performed similarly to meta-ROI measures of Tau-MaX. Together, these findings indicate that combining magnitude and extent provides a robust measure of global tau burden that changes throughout the disease course and is associated with blood-based biomarkers and cognition. This measure may be of particular use for disease staging, as well as serving as an outcome measure to monitor response to therapeutic intervention.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences

Predicting and monitoring the decline and onset of dementia is a diagnostic challenge and of essence in daily care and support for people with DS. In this literature scoping review, we first summarize the different blood-based biomarkers for AD in DS. Next, we describe urine-based biomarkers for AD in DS and finally, we explore various blood-based biomarkers in the general AD population. Apart from the classic amyloid beta and Tau biomarkers, we also discuss more out-of-the-box biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain, Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A, and monoaminergic biomarkers. These potential biomarkers could be a valuable addition to the established panel of fluid biomarkers.",Heliyon

39820231,Systematic review of amyloid-beta clearance proteins from the brain to the periphery: implications for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and therapeutic targets.,"Amyloid-beta clearance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the variation in functional proteins involved in amyloid-beta clearance and their correlation with amyloid-beta levels remain unclear. In this study, we conducted meta-analyses and a systematic review using studies from the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, including journal articles published from inception to June 30, 2023. The inclusion criteria included studies comparing the levels of functional proteins associated with amyloid-beta clearance in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain of healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between these functional proteins and amyloid-beta levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed via the Newcastle‒Ottawa Scale. Owing to heterogeneity, we utilized either a fixed-effect or random-effect model to assess the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the standard mean difference (SMD) among healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer's disease. The findings revealed significant alterations in the levels of insulin-degrading enzymes, neprilysin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, cathepsin D, receptor for advanced glycation end products, and P-glycoprotein in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. In cerebrospinal fluid, the levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 are altered, whereas the levels of TREM2, CD40, CD40L, CD14, CD22, cathepsin D, cystatin C, and α2 M in peripheral blood differ. Notably, TREM2 and cathepsin D showed changes in both brain (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.16-0.47, P < 0.001, I2 = 78.4%; SMD = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.01-2.48, P = 0.048, I2 = 90.1%) and peripheral blood (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.35-1.66, P = 0.003, I2 = 96.5%; SMD = 7.55, 95% CI: 3.92-11.18, P < 0.001, I2 = 98.2%) samples. Furthermore, correlations were observed between amyloid-beta levels and the levels of TREM2 ( r = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04-0.28, P = 0.009, I2 = 74.7%), neprilysin ( r = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.80-0.14, P = 0.005, I2 = 76.1%), and P-glycoprotein ( r = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.51-0.11, P = 0.002, I2 = 0.0%) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and cathepsin D could serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, whereas triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, neprilysin, and P-glycoprotein may represent potential therapeutic targets.",Neural regeneration research
39740225,MRI free water mediates the association between diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space and executive function in four independent middle to aged cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index was proposed for assessing glymphatic clearance function. This study evaluated DTI-ALPS as a biomarker for cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) related vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). METHODS: Four independent cohorts were examined. A composite score of executive function (UDS3-EF) was used to evaluate EF status. The association between the ALPS index and UDS3-EF scores and the mediator effect of free water in white matter (WM-FW) on such association was analyzed. RESULTS: The ALPS index was significantly associated with UDS3-EF scores in all cohorts. Additionally, WM-FW mediates the relationship between the ALPS index and UDS3-EF scores. DISCUSSION: Lower ALPS index may be a surrogate marker of glymphatic dysfunction, which is associated with impaired EF, and this association is mediated by the interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage ISF in WM, providing a clinical rationale for using ALPS index as a biomarker for cSVD-related VCID. HIGHLIGHTS: This is the first study to investigate the mediation role of interstitial FW fraction (WM-FW) on the relationship between glymphatic clearance (ALPS index) and EF (UDS3-EF scores) in four independent middle to aged cohorts at risk for cSVD. This study identified that ALPS index was independently associated with UDS3-EF scores after adjusting for demographics, VRFs, and WM hyperintensity burden and that WM-FW mediated this association in all middle to aged cohorts. Our findings suggest that in middle to aged individuals, glymphatic dysfunction (reflected by ALPS index) is strongly associated with EF and that this association is mediated by the ISF drainage in WM. This study provides a strong clinical rationale for the use of the ALPS index as a marker of cognitive function in multi-site observational studies and clinical trials to monitor and prevent VCID.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

40134533,Alteration of prefrontal functional connectivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: an fNIRS study.,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital for delaying its progression through timely intervention. The preclinical stage, the longest phase of AD, often goes undetected due to a lack of noticeable symptoms. Developing an accessible and quantitative screening method for AD is essential for enabling appropriate interventions during this stage. METHODS: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate prefrontal functional connectivity in preclinical AD subjects. A total of 99 participants, including healthy controls and preclinical subjects who were amyloid beta (Aβ) positive (n = 45), were recruited. We designed a mixed phonemic and semantic verbal fluency task for the experimental protocol. Functional connectivity was then analyzed as z-values in the left, right, and interhemispheric prefrontal regions during a verbal fluency task. Finally, we assessed the correlation between the participants' z-values and clinical indices. RESULTS: The preclinical AD group exhibited increased interhemispheric functional connectivity derived from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during verbal tasks involving the first phonemic letter. Additionally, significant right and left functional connectivity differences were observed in the healthy control group during verbal tasks with the letter and categories, but not in the preclinical AD group. Lastly, the difference in interhemispheric functional connectivity of oxygenated hemoglobin between the first and second verbal trials was significantly greater in the preclinical AD group. These interhemispheric functional connectivity values were significantly correlated with Aβ results from positron emission tomography. CONCLUSION: The initial increase and subsequent reduction of interhemispheric functional connectivity in the preclinical AD group across task repetitions suggests that task-related prefrontal network alterations may occur during the preclinical phase of AD and shows its potential as a biomarker for screening preclinical AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39944114,Focus groups on digital cognitive assessment in the context of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Digital cognitive assessments (DCAs) may facilitate early recognition of cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While DCAs are increasingly emerging, they are often not used in practice. We assessed facilitators and barriers of using DCAs according to older individuals and patients. METHODS: In five focus groups, we presented three different DCAs to older individuals with unimpaired cognition (n = 14), subjective cognitive decline (n = 11) and mild cognitive impairment with biomarker-confirmed AD (n = 4) and their caregivers (n = 2). Participants discussed facilitators and barriers that could influence the use of DCAs. Focus groups were recorded, and transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: (1) test motivation ('Do I want to know my brain health?'), facilitated by early disease recognition, while impeded by fear of dementia; (2) digital test suitability ('Do I want to use a digital test?'), enabling at-home testing, while lacking personal contact; and (3) digital test characteristics ('What makes a digital test a good test for me?'), where user-friendliness was emphasized as a key facilitator to overcome digital incompetence. DISCUSSION: Participants recognized the added value of DCAs, and multiple factors were identified as facilitators and barriers for their use. Similar factors could be a barrier for one, yet facilitated others, underlining the need for a personalized approach. Strategies to minimize barriers and exploit facilitators would ultimately foster implementation.",Digital health
40255689,EEG-based graph network analysis in relation to regional tau in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.,"Tau aggregation in early affected regions in the asymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease marks a transitional phase between stable asymptomatic amyloid positivity and the clinically manifest stage. How this early region tau aggregation covertly affects brain function during this asymptomatic stage remains unclear. In this study, 83 participants underwent a 128 electrodes resting-state EEG, a dynamic 100 min tau PET scan ((18)F-MK6240), an amyloid PET scan, a structural T1 MRI scan and neuropsychological assessment. Tau PET data quality control led to a final sample of 66 subjects. Based on the clinical and cognitive status, amyloid and tau PET biomarkers, the group was composed of 37 cognitively unimpaired amyloid negative subjects, 14 cognitively unimpaired amyloid positive subjects and 15 patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. We calculated the average undirected weighted Phase Lag Index in the alpha frequency band with eyes closed and used this as weights for the graph and analysed the global clustering coefficient and characteristic path length in sensor space. As a primary objective, we assessed how these global graph measures correlated with tau PET values, in an a priori defined early metaVOI, comprised of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus and fusiform cortex. As secondary analyses, we investigated which specific brain regions were mainly implicated, what the contribution was of amyloid, the effect of electrode density and the relation to cognitive performance. In the overall group and within the cognitively unimpaired amyloid positive subgroup, tau aggregation was associated with a decrease in global clustering coefficient and an increase in characteristic path length. These changes reflect the initial disintegration of the small-world brain network during the transitional phase, even before clinical symptoms are apparent. The correlations are most prominent in the perirhinal cortex, indicating that global deterioration of the network is already present early in the Alzheimer's disease pathology. We obtained similar results with only taking 64 electrodes into account. To conclude, we found that in the asymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease, tau PET load in medial temporal cortex is associated with global electrophysiological measures of network disintegration. The study demonstrates the potential value of high-density EEG in the era of biologically defined Alzheimer's disease for characterizing brain function in the asymptomatic stage.",Brain communications

39868172,Oral prodrug of a novel glutathione surrogate reverses metabolic dysregulation and attenuates neurodegenerative process in APP/PS1 mice.,"Glycation-induced oxidative stress underlies the numerous metabolic ravages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced glutathione levels in AD lead to increased oxidative stress, including glycation-induced pathology. Previously, we showed that the accumulation of reactive 1,2-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal, the major precursor of non-enzymatic glycation products, was reduced by the increased function of GSH-dependent glyoxalase-1 enzyme in the brain. In this two-pronged study, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an orally bioavailable prodrug of our lead glyoxalase substrate, pro-ψ-GSH, for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This prodrug delivers pharmacodynamically relevant brain concentrations of ψ-GSH upon oral delivery. Chronic oral dosing of pro-ψ-GSH effectively reverses the cognitive decline observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model. The prodrug successfully mirrors the robust effects of the parent drug i.e., reducing amyloid pathology, glycation stress, neuroinflammation, and the resultant neurodegeneration in these mice. We also report the first metabolomics study of such a treatment, which yields key biomarkers linked to the reversal of AD-related metabolic dysregulation. Collectively, this study establishes pro-ψ-GSH as a viable, disease-modifying therapy for AD and paves the way for further preclinical advancement of such therapeutics. Metabolomic signatures identified could prove beneficial in the development of treatment-specific clinically translatable biomarkers.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
39975923,Lower Network Functional Connectivity Is Associated With Higher Regional Tau Burden Among Those At-Risk of Alzheimer's Disease But Cognitively Unimpaired: Specific Patterns Based on Amyloid Status.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional connectivity within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and default mode network (DMN) changes across Alzheimer's disease stages, influenced by and influencing cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) and regional tau burden. Previous research highlights functional connectivity's role in Alzheimer's disease progression and the interactions of cortical Aβ and functional connectivity within and between the MTL and DMN, but their impact on regional tau deposition remains largely unexplored. METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from OASIS-3 (AV1451 cohort, n=287) were classified into Aβ- (n=193) and Aβ+ (n=94) groups via amyloid-PET for cross-sectional analyses. Principal components analysis of functional connectivity identified two MTL-functional connectivity and DMN-functional connectivity principal components (PCs), which were correlated with regional tau per Braak stages 1-6 brain regions. Aβ status-specific robust regressions evaluated whether functional connectivity was associated with tau. RESULTS: In Aβ- participants, lower ""MTL Integration Axis"" functional connectivity (PC1) was associated with higher tau levels in the left entorhinal cortex. In Aβ+ participants, lower ""MTL Integration Axis"" functional connectivity correlated with elevated tau levels in the DMN's left lateral parietal cortex, MTL's right parahippocampal cortex, and Braak stages 3-6 brain regions. DISCUSSION: Decreased functional connectivity was associated with increased regional tau burden, showing Aβ status-specific effects. Enhancing MTL functional connectivity could be a therapeutic strategy and a promising direction for future clinical interventions.",Research square
40444147,APOE4 and chronic health risk factors are associated with sex-specific preclinical Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging biomarkers.,"INTRODUCTION: Two thirds of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are female. Genetic and chronic health risk factors for AD affect females more negatively compared to males. OBJECTIVE: This multimodal neuroimaging study aimed to examine sex differences in cognitively unimpaired older adults on: (1) amyloid-β via 18F-AV-45 Florbetapir PET imaging, (2) neurodegeneration via T1 weighted MRI volumetrics, (3) cerebral blood flow via ASL-MRI. We identified AD risk factors including genetic (APOE genotype status) and health markers (fasting glucose, mean arterial pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, and android and gynoid body fat) associated with neuroimaging outcomes for which we observed sex differences. METHODS: Participants were sedentary, amyloid-β positive older adults (N = 112, ages 65-87 years) without evidence of cognitive impairment (CDR = 0). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of covariance models adjusted for intracranial volume, age, and years of education demonstrated lower volume [F (7, 102) = 2.67, p = 0.014] and higher blood flow F (6, 102) = 4.25, p ≤ 0.001) among females compared to males in regions of interest connected to AD pathology and the estrogen receptor network. We did not observe sex differences in amyloid-β levels. Higher than optimal waist to hip ratio was most strongly associated with lower volume among female participants. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest genetic and chronic health risk factors are associated with sex-specific AD neuroimaging biomarkers. Underlying sex-specific biological pathways may explain these findings. Our results highlight the importance of considering sex differences in neuroimaging studies and when developing effective interventions for AD prevention and risk reduction.",Frontiers in global women's health
39834035,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: State-of-the-science update and narrative review.,"OBJECTIVE: The long-recognized association of brain injury with increased risk of dementia has undergone significant refinement and more detailed study in recent decades. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a specific neurodegenerative tauopathy related to prior exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI). We aim to contextualize CTE within a historical perspective and among emerging data which highlights the scientific and conceptual evolution of CTE-related research in parallel with the broader field of neurodegenerative disease and dementia. METHODS: We provide a narrative state-of-the-science update on CTE neuropathology, clinical manifestations, biomarkers, different types and patterns of head impact exposure relevant for CTE, and the complicated influence of neurodegenerative co-pathology on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Now almost 20 years since the initial case report of CTE in a former American football player, the field of CTE continues evolving with increasing clarity but also several ongoing controversies. Our understanding of CTE neuropathology outpaces that of disease-specific clinical correlates or the development of in-vivo biomarkers. Diagnostic criteria for symptoms attributable to CTE are still being validated, but leveraging increasingly available biomarkers for other conditions like Alzheimer's disease may be helpful for informing the CTE differential diagnosis. As diagnostic refinement efforts advance, clinicians should provide care and/or referrals to providers best suited to treat an individual patient's clinical symptoms, many of which have evidence-based behavioral treatment options that are etiologically agnostic. Several ongoing research initiatives and the gradual accrual of gold standard clinico-pathological data will pay dividends for advancing the many existing gaps in the field of CTE.",The Clinical neuropsychologist
39851322,Multivariate Analyses with Two-Step Dimension Reduction for an Association Study Between (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B and Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in brain tissues. To study the relationship between Aβ deposition and brain structure, as determined using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively, we developed a regression model with PiB and MRI data as the predictor and response variables, respectively, and proposed a regression method for studying the association between them based on a supervised sparse multivariate analysis with dimension reduction based on a composite paired basis function. By applying this method to imaging data of 61 patients with AD (age: 55-85), the first component showed the strongest correlation with the composite score, owing to the supervised feature. The spatial pattern included the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions for MRI. The peak value was observed in the posterior cingulate and precuneus for PiB. The differences in PiB scores among the diagnosis groups 12 months after PiB imaging were significant between the normal and AD groups (p = 0.0284), but not between the normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups or the MCI and AD groups (p = 0.3508). Our method may facilitate the development of a dementia biomarker from brain imaging data. Scoring imaging data allows for visualization and the application of traditional analysis, facilitating clinical analysis for better interpretation of results.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)"
40547214,"Integrative bioinformatics and machine learning identify iron metabolism genes MAP4, GPT, and HIRIP3 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and the accumulation of pathological markers such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent evidence suggests a role for dysregulated iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain largely undefined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the role of iron metabolism in AD, we utilized an integrative bioinformatics approach that combines weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) with machine learning techniques, including LASSO regression and Generalized Linear Models (GLM), to identify hub genes associated with AD. We used transcriptomic data derived from postmortem prefrontal cortex samples (GSE132903, comprising 97 AD cases and 98 controls). To assess changes in the immune microenvironment, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was employed. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were performed to uncover the underlying biological mechanisms driving these alterations. Protein validation was carried out in APP/PS1 transgenic mice through Western blotting. RESULTS: Three genes related to iron metabolism-MAP4, GPT, and HIRIP3-are identified as strong biomarkers. The GLM classifier showed high diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.879). AD samples had increased immune activity, with more M1 macrophages and neutrophils, indicating neuroinflammation. MAP4 and GPT were linked to Notch signaling and metabolic issues. In APP/PS1 mice, MAP4 decreased, while GPT and HIRIP3 increased. DISCUSSION: This analysis highlights these genes as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, connecting iron balance, neuroinflammation, and metabolic problems in AD. The immune profile suggests potential for immunomodulatory treatments, enhancing understanding of AD and aiding precision diagnostics and therapies.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience

40018519,Deciphering novel mitochondrial signatures: multi-omics analysis uncovers cross-disease markers and oligodendrocyte pathways in Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM) are severe neurological disorders that pose significant global healthcare challenges. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction, remain poorly understood. A major limitation in current studies is the lack of cell-specific markers that effectively represent mitochondrial dynamics in AD and GBM. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data using 10 machine learning algorithms to identify mitochondria-associated cell-specific markers. We validated these markers through the integration of gene expression and methylation data across diverse cell types. Our dataset comprised single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from AD patients, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from GBM patients, and additional DNA methylation and transcriptomic data from the ROSMAP, ADNI, TCGA, and CGGA cohorts. RESULTS: Our analysis identified four significant cross-disease mitochondrial markers: EFHD1, SASH1, FAM110B, and SLC25A18. These markers showed both shared and unique expression profiles in AD and GBM, suggesting a common mitochondrial mechanism contributing to both diseases. Additionally, oligodendrocytes and their interactions with astrocytes were implicated in disease progression, particularly through the APP signaling pathway. Key hub genes, such as HS6ST3 and TUBB2B, were identified across different cellular subpopulations, highlighting a cell-specific co-expression network linked to mitochondrial function.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40357390,Bundle-wise functional connectivity density and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations decrease in white matter in preclinical Alzheimer's disease and are associated with Aβ levels and cognition.,"Neurophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin decades before clinical symptoms emerge, during preclinical AD. Functional abnormalities in white matter (WM) at this preclinical stage remain largely unexplored. We obtained resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of 295 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and evaluated bundle-wise functional connectivity density (FCD) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) across 46 bundles, which reflects the strength of synchronizations of BOLD dynamics between each WM bundle and whole-brain 200 GM parcels, and spontaneous neural activity of each WM bundle, respectively. To mitigate site/scanner effects on the metrics, ComBat harmonization was applied to the data. We then performed permutation tests (n=5,000) on each harmonized metric for each bundle to determine differences in FCD and fALFF in preclinical AD relative to controls, adjusting for sex, age, and education using multiple linear regression. Linear correlations of the metrics with the pathological biomarker beta-amyloid (Aβ) and cognitive scores (mPACC and ADAS11) were assessed using general linear models. Multiple comparisons were corrected via a false discovery rate (FDR). We found that preclinical AD patients had reduced FCD and fALFF in specific WM bundles, such as cingulate and hippocampal cingulum, compared to controls (FDR corrected p < 0.05), some of which were associated with poorer cognitive performance and greater Aβ accumulation (FDR corrected p < 0.05). This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to examine bundle-wise FCD and fALFF of WM in preclinical AD using a large-scale, multi-site, cross-sectional dataset, suggesting potential applications of these metrics for assessing preclinical AD with rs-fMRI.",Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering
39926613,"CSF biomarkers are differentially linked to brain areas high and low in noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.","Neurotransmitter systems of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine are implicated in cognitive functions such as memory, learning and attention and are known to be altered in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Specific brain structures involved in these systems, e.g. the locus coeruleus, the main source of noradrenaline in the cortex, are in fact affected earliest by Alzheimer's disease tau pathology. Preserved volumetric neurotransmitter specific brain areas could therefore be an important neural resource for cognitive reserve in aging. The aim of this study was to determine whether volumes of brain areas known to be high in neurotransmitter receptors are relatively preserved in individuals with lower levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Based on the Human Protein Atlas for neurotransmitter receptor distribution, we distinguished between 'areas high and low' in noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine and assessed associations of atrophy in those areas with CSF amyloid-ß 42/40, CSF phosphorylated tau protein and cognitive function across healthy controls (n = 122), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 156), mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 126) using structural equation modelling. CSF pathology markers were inversely correlated and showed a stronger association with disease severity, suggesting distinguishable interrelatedness of these biomarkers depending on the stage of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Across groups, amyloid pathology was linked to atrophy in areas high as well as low in neurotransmitter receptor densities, while tau pathology did not show any significant link to brain area volumes for any of the neurotransmitters. Within disease severity groups, individuals with more amyloid pathology showed more atrophy only in 'areas high in noradrenaline', whereas for dopamine tau pathology was linked to higher volumes in areas low in receptor density possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. Furthermore, individuals with more tau pathology showed a selective decrease in memory function while amyloid pathology was related to a decline in executive function and language capacity as well as memory function. In summary, our analyses highlight the benefits of investigating disease-relevant factors in Alzheimer's disease using a multivariate multigroup approach. Assessing multivariate dependencies in different disease stages and across individuals revealed selective links of pathologies, cognitive decline and atrophy in particular for areas modulated by noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin.",Brain communications
39980634,Blood-based biomarkers in mild behavioral impairment: an updated overview.,"Identifying individuals at-risk for dementia is one of the critical objectives of current research efforts, highlighting the need for simple, cost-effective, and minimally invasive biomarkers. Mild behavioral impairment (MBI), characterized by the emergence of persistent neuropsychiatric manifestations in older adults, has attracted increasing attention as a potential early indicator of cognitive decline and dementia. A growing number of studies have recently begun to explore the relationship between MBI and several blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, neurodegeneration, as well as systemic metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation. In this context, MBI has been associated with lower plasma Aβ42/Αβ40 ratio, higher plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), increased neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, as well as disturbances in metabolic markers, including homocysteine, insulin and ferritin, suggesting a multifaceted neurobiological basis for this syndrome. These findings offer insights into the underlying pathophysiology of MBI, and connection between neuropsychiatric symptoms and progression of AD. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and critically discuss the emerging literature evidence linking MBI to blood-based biomarkers, hoping to shed more light on MBI's pathophysiology, its connection to AD-related neurobiology, as well as its potential practical utility for predicting cognitive impairment, guiding early interventions and managing the risk for dementia.",Frontiers in neurology
40134691,Efficacy of Ginkgo biloba as an adjunct to donepezil in amyloid PET-positive Alzheimer's patients.,"BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba is widely used in some regions as an adjunct therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its potential mechanisms include antioxidative and anti-amyloid properties, yet clinical evidence remains mixed. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether combining Ginkgo with donepezil confers additional benefits in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. We also explored changes in the plasma biomarker MDS-Oaβ (Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Aβ), which reflects the propensity of Aβ monomers to form oligomers. METHODS: This retrospective study included newly diagnosed, drug-naïve AD patients who were amyloid PET-positive and had at least 12 months of follow-up. Participants received either donepezil alone (Donepezil-only) or donepezil plus Ginkgo (Donepezil-Ginkgo). Clinical measures included the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and the Sum of Boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB). Plasma MDS-Oaβ was assessed at baseline and at 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed (60 Donepezil-only, 41 Donepezil-Ginkgo). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar. After 12 months, the Donepezil-only group showed minimal change in K-MMSE and a slight decrease in MDS-Oaβ. The Donepezil-Ginkgo group demonstrated a significant improvement in K-MMSE (+2.4) and a larger reduction in MDS-Oaβ (-0.15). No significant between-group difference was observed for CDR-SB. Adverse events were mostly mild and did not lead to discontinuation. CONCLUSION: The addition of Ginkgo to donepezil may yield superior cognitive outcomes and a greater decrease in plasma MDS-Oaβ compared with donepezil alone in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. Further large-scale, prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate Ginkgo's mechanistic role in AD.",Frontiers in neurology

39879633,Plasma phosphorylated tau217 strongly associates with memory deficits in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.,"Plasma phosphorylated tau biomarkers open unprecedented opportunities for identifying carriers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in early disease stages using minimally invasive techniques. Plasma p-tau biomarkers are believed to reflect tau phosphorylation and secretion. However, it remains unclear to what extent the magnitude of plasma p-tau abnormalities reflects neuronal network disturbance in the form of cognitive impairment. To address this question, we included 103 cognitively unimpaired elderly and 40 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive individuals from the TRIAD cohort, as well as 336 cognitively unimpaired and 216 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive older adults from the BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants had tau PET scans, amyloid PET scans or amyloid CSF, p-tau217, p-tau181 and p-tau231 blood measures, structural T1-MRI and cognitive assessments. In this cross-sectional study, we used regression models and correlation analyses to assess the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores. Furthermore, we applied receiver operating characteristic curves to assess cognitive impairment across plasma biomarkers. Finally, we categorized participants into amyloid (A), p-tau (T1), and tau PET (T2) positive (+) or negative (-) profiles and ran nonparametric comparisons to assess differences across cognitive domains. We found that plasma p-tau217 was more associated with cognitive performance than p-tau181 and p-tau231, and that this relationship was particularly strong for memory scores (TRIAD: βp-tau217=-0.53; βp-tau181=-0.35; βp-tau231=-0.24; BioFINDER-2: βp-tau217=-0.52; βp-tau181=-0.24; βp-tau231=-0.29). Associations in amyloid-β positive participants resembled these results, but other cognitive scores also showed strong associations in cognitively impaired individuals. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 and plasma p-tau231 in identifying memory impairment (Area Under the Curve values for TRIAD: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.77, p-tau231=0.75; Area Under the Curve values for BioFINDER-2: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.81), and in identifying executive function impairment only in the BioFINDER-2 cohort (p-tau217=0.82, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.76). Lastly, we showed that subtle memory deficits were present in A+T1+T2- participants for plasma p-tau217 (p=0.007) and plasma p-tau181 (p=0.01) in the TRIAD cohort, and for all biomarkers across cognitive domains in A+T1-T2- and A+T1+T2- individuals (p<0.001 in all) in the BioFINDER-2 cohort. A+T1+T2+ individuals showed cognitive deficits in both cohorts (p<0.001 in all). Together, our results suggest that plasma p-tau217 stands out as a biomarker capable of identifying memory deficits due to Alzheimer's disease and that memory impairment certainly occurs in amyloid and plasma p-tau positive individuals that have no significant amounts of tau in the neocortex.",Brain : a journal of neurology
39840612,Monogenic causes of cerebral small vessel disease- models for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advancements in molecular biomarkers and therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease have brought into focus the need for greater progress in the second most common cause of dementia, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We examine how the study of monogenic causes of VCID has contributed to the understanding of its pathophysiology and potential biomarker and treatment research. RECENT FINDINGS: It is widely accepted that conditions which disrupt the cerebral small vessels contribute to vascular pathologies including stroke and cerebral microbleeds, ultimately leading to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Among these conditions are a range of monogenic small vessel diseases (SVDs) such as CADASIL, CARASIL, Fabry disease and COL4A-related disorders. SUMMARY: This review indicates the importance of furthering research into monogenic SVDs in order to gain insight into the pathomechanisms of VCID more broadly. Monogenic conditions are easier to model than sporadic VCID and can serve as a guide for identifying biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring and intervention outcomes.",Current opinion in psychiatry
40002692,Beyond Amyloid and Tau: The Critical Role of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is traditionally viewed through the lens of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, implicating amyloid-beta and tau protein aggregates as the main pathological culprits. However, burgeoning research points to the brain's resident immune cells, microglia, as critical players in AD pathogenesis, progression, and potential therapeutic interventions. This review examines the dynamic roles of microglia within the intricate framework of AD. We detail the involvement of these immune cells in neuroinflammation, explaining how their activation and response fluctuations may influence the disease trajectory. We further elucidate the complex relationship between microglia and amyloid-beta pathology. This study highlights the dual nature of these cells, which contribute to both aggregation and clearance of the amyloid-beta protein. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the interplay between microglia and tau unveils the significant, yet often overlooked, impact of this interaction on neurodegeneration in AD. Shifting from the conventional therapeutic approaches, we assess the current AD treatments primarily targeting amyloid and tau and introduce novel strategies that involve manipulating microglial functions. These innovative methods herald a potential paradigm shift in the management of AD. Finally, we explore the burgeoning field of precision diagnosis and the pursuit of robust AD biomarkers. We underline how a more profound comprehension of microglial biology could enrich these essential areas, potentially paving the way for more accurate diagnostic tools and tailored treatment strategies. In conclusion, this review expands on the conventional perspective of AD pathology and treatment, drawing attention to the multifaceted roles of microglia. As we continue to enhance our understanding of these cells, microglial-focused therapeutic interventions emerge as a promising frontier to bolster our arsenal to fight against AD.",Biomedicines
39787363,The potential role of machine learning and deep learning in differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and FTD using imaging biomarkers: A review.,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has significantly increased, necessitating a deeper understanding of their symptoms, diagnostic processes, and prevention strategies. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two prominent neurodegenerative conditions that present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping symptoms. To address these challenges, experts utilize a range of imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These techniques facilitate a detailed examination of the manifestations of these diseases. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in automating the diagnostic process, generating significant interest in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This narrative review aims to compile and analyze articles related to the AI-assisted diagnosis of FTD and AD. We reviewed 31 articles published between 2012 and 2024, with 23 focusing on machine learning techniques and 8 on deep learning techniques. The studies utilized features extracted from both single imaging modalities and multi-modal approaches, and evaluated the performance of various classification models. RESULTS: Among the machine learning studies, Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibited the most favorable performance in classifying FTD and AD. In deep learning studies, the ResNet convolutional neural network outperformed other networks. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the utility of different imaging modalities as diagnostic aids in distinguishing between FTD and AD. However, it emphasizes the importance of incorporating clinical examinations and patient symptom evaluations to ensure comprehensive and accurate diagnoses.",The neuroradiology journal

No studies have investigated the relationship of TOMM40 rs2075650 ('650) on the structural complexity of the brain or plasma markers of neurodegeneration. We used a comprehensive approach to quantify the impact of TOMM40 '650 on brain morphology and multiple cortical attributes in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. We also tested whether the presence of the risk allele, G, of TOMM40 '650 was associated with plasma markers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration and if there were interactions with age and sex, controlling for the effects of APOE ε4. We found that the TOMM40 '650 G-allele was associated with decreased sulcal depth, increased gyrification index, and decreased gray matter volume. NfL, GFAP, and pTau181 had independent and age-associated increases in individuals with a G-allele.

40093920,Retinal microvascular density and inner thickness in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major healthcare challenge, with existing diagnostics being costly/infeasible. This study explores retinal biomarkers from optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) as a cost-effective and non-invasive solution to differentiate AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Participants from the CALLIOPE Research Program were classified as ""Dem"" (AD and early AD), ""MCI,"" and ""HCs"" using neuropsychological tests and clinical diagnosis by a neurologist. OCT/OCTA examinations were conducted using the RTVue XR 100 Avanti SD-OCT system (VISIONIX), with retinal parameters extracted. Statistical analysis included normality and homogeneity of variance (HOV) tests to select ANOVA methods. Post-hoc analyses utilized Mann-Whitney U, Dunnett, or Tukey-HSD tests based on parameters' normality and HOV. Correlations with age were assessed via Pearson or Spearman tests. A generalized linear model (GLM) using Tweedie regression modeled the relationship between OCT/OCTA parameters and MMSE scores, correcting for age. Another ordinal logistic GLM (OL-GLM) modeled OCT/OCTA parameters against classes, adjusting for multiple confounders. RESULTS: We analyzed 357 participants: 44 Dem, 139 MCI, and 174 HCs. Significant microvascular density (VD) reductions around the fovea were linked with MCI and Dem compared to HCs. Age-related analysis associated thickness parameters with HCs' old age. Our OL-GLM demonstrated significant thickness/volume reductions in Inner_Retina and Full_Retina layers. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and perimeter were initially not correlated with cognitive decline; however, OL-GLM significantly associated FAZ perimeter enlargement with Dem and MCI groups. Significant average and inferior peripapillary RNFL thinning were linked to Dem and MCI groups. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine VD changes in G grid sections among Dem, MCI, and HCs. We found a significant association between various VD parameters and cognitive decline. Most macular thickness/volume changes did not correlate with cognitive decline initially; however, our OL-GLM succeeded, highlighting the importance of the confounders' corrections. Our analysis excluded individual retinal layer parameters due to limitations; however, the literature suggests their value. Our study confirmed existing biomarkers' efficacy and uncovered novel retinal parameters for cognitive decline, requiring further validation.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40103927,Comparing machine learning classifier models in discriminating cognitively unimpaired older adults from three clinical cohorts in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum: demonstration analyses in the COMPASS-ND study.,"BACKGROUND: Research in aging, impairment, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) often requires powerful computational models for discriminating between clinical cohorts and identifying early biomarkers and key risk or protective factors. Machine Learning (ML) approaches represent a diverse set of data-driven tools for performing such tasks in big or complex datasets. We present systematic demonstration analyses to compare seven frequently used ML classifier models and two eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques on multiple performance metrics for a common neurodegenerative disease dataset. The aim is to identify and characterize the best performing ML and XAI algorithms for the present data. METHOD: We accessed a Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging dataset featuring four well-characterized cohorts: Cognitively Unimpaired (CU), Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD (N = 255). All participants contributed 102 multi-modal biomarkers and risk factors. Seven ML algorithms were compared along six performance metrics in discriminating between cohorts. Two XAI algorithms were compared using five performance and five similarity metrics. RESULTS: Although all ML models performed relatively well in the extreme-cohort comparison (CU/AD), the Super Learner (SL), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient-Boosted trees (GB) algorithms excelled in the challenging near-cohort comparisons (CU/SCI). For the XAI interpretation comparison, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) generally outperformed Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanation (LIME) in key performance properties. CONCLUSION: The ML results indicate that two tree-based methods (RF and GB) are reliable and effective as initial models for classification tasks involving discrete clinical aging and neurodegeneration data. In the XAI phase, SHAP performed better than LIME due to lower computational time (when applied to RF and GB) and incorporation of feature interactions, leading to more reliable results.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience

Key institutions include the NIH and the University of California System, while journals such as Journal of Biological Chemistry and PLOS ONE show significant growth. Prominent authors include Masliah, Eliezer, and Heaton, RK. Research highlights the overlap between HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and AD, emphasizing shared mechanisms like neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Recent advances focus on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, oxidative stress, and the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on neurological outcomes. Studies increasingly explore the role of advanced methodologies, including machine learning, in elucidating shared mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and protein misfolding.

40013172,Atypical Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease in a Young Female: A Case Report.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles at an earlier age. It affects multiple cognitive domains, including memory, executive function, and motor abilities. Here, we present a case of atypical early-onset AD. A 33-year-old woman with no significant medical history experienced a two-year decline in cognitive function, resulting in job loss and incidents such as cooking-related fires. Neurological examination revealed impaired attention, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and a dystaxic gait. Imaging and tests showed minor abnormalities, with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, autoimmune, and metabolic workups. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scans indicated cortical atrophy and parietal hypometabolism. The patient was referred to a memory center for further evaluation and potential treatment with lecanemab. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing early-onset neurodegenerative disorders, which can present atypically and mimic other conditions. The extensive diagnostic workup emphasizes the difficulty of diagnosing these disorders, particularly in the absence of specific biomarkers. Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders in young adults requires heightened clinical suspicion and a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including advanced brain imaging, such as MRI and PET scans, to ensure timely diagnosis and referral to specialized centers.",Cureus

The study aimed to initially explore the relationship between plasma exosomal microRNAs, gut microbiota, and cognitive impairment, providing insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of AD. METHODS: The study enrolled 8 participants with AD and 8 participants with normal cognition. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was utilized to evaluate cognitive function. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma exosomes, while metagenomic sequencing was employed to detect differences in the abundance of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the associations among them were analyzed. RESULTS: Four exosomal miRNAs and 14 microbiota taxa, which exhibited differential expression and abundance, respectively, in comparison between AD group and normal cognition group, were identified to be significantly associated with MMSE scores. Notably, the abundance of potential probiotics, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis and Roseburia inulinivorans, which was decreased in AD patients, exhibited positive correlations with specific exosomal miRNAs: Roseburia intestinalis correlated with miR-3120-3p and miR-6529-5p; Roseburia inulinivorans correlated with miR-3120-3p, miR-6529-5p and miR-124-3p; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii correlated with miR-3120-3p. DISCUSSION: The study revealed a close association among gut microbiota, plasma exosomal miRNAs, and cognitive impairment in AD, and suggested that specific components of gut microbiota and exosomal miRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Frontiers in neuroscience
39572782,Diets to promote healthy brain ageing.,"Diet is a modifiable lifestyle factor with a proven role in cardiovascular disease risk reduction that might also play an important part in cognitive health. Evidence from observational studies has linked certain healthy dietary patterns to cognitive benefits. However, clinical trials of diet interventions have demonstrated either null or, at best, small effects on cognitive outcomes. In this Review, we summarize the currently available evidence from observational epidemiology and clinical trials regarding the potential role of diet in the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. We further discuss possible methodological limitations that might have hindered the ability of previous diet intervention trials to capture potential neuroprotective effects. Considering the overwhelming and continuously expanding societal, economic and health-care burden of Alzheimer disease and other dementias, future nutritional research must address past methodological challenges to accurately and reliably inform clinical practice guidelines and public health policies. Within this scope, we provide a roadmap for future diet intervention trials for dementia prevention. We discuss study designs involving both intensive personalized interventions - to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, establish neuroprotective thresholds, and test hypothesized biological mechanisms and effects on brain health and cognition through sensitive and precise biomarker measures - and large-scale, pragmatic public health interventions to study population-level benefits.",Nature reviews.

40182143,Differential cognitive functioning in the digital clock drawing test in AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), but there are differences in pathogenesis and cognitive performance between Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI) and Parkinson's disease with Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) populations. Studies have shown that assessments based on the digital clock drawing test (dCDT) can effectively reflect cognitive deficits. Based on this, we proposed the following research hypothesis: there is a difference in cognitive functioning between AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations in the CDT, and the two populations can be effectively distinguished based on this feature. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we designed the dCDT to extract digital biomarkers that can characterize and quantify cognitive function differences between AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations. We enrolled a total of 40 AD-MCI patients, 40 PD-MCI patients, 41 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) patients and 40 normal cognition (NC) controls. RESULTS: Through a cross-sectional study, we revealed a difference in cognitive function between AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations in the dCDT, which distinguished AD-MCI from PD-MCI patients, the area under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.923, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.866-0.983. The AUC for effective differentiation between AD-MCI and PD-MCI patients with high education (≥12 years of education) was 0.968, CI = 0.927-1.000. By correlation analysis, we found that the overall plotting of task performance score (VFDB (1)) correlated with the [visuospatial/executive] subtest score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [R] = 0.472, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The dCDT is a tool that can rapidly and accurately characterize and quantify differences in cognitive functioning in AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations.",Frontiers in neuroscience
40034518,Machine learning uncovers novel sex-specific dementia biomarkers linked to autism and eye diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted significant interest as predictive biomarkers for various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Machine learning (ML) methods enable the integration of miRNAs into highly accurate predictive models of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs across dementia subtypes compared to normal controls (NC) and analyze their enriched biological and disease pathways. Additionally, to evaluate the use of these miRNAs in binary and multiclass ML models for dementia prediction in both overall and sex-specific datasets. METHODS: Using data comprising 1685 Japanese individuals (GSE120584 and GSE167559), we performed differential expression analysis to identify miRNAs associated with five dementia groups in both overall and sex-specific datasets. Pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to further analyze these miRNAs. ML classifiers were used to create predictive models of dementia. RESULTS: We identified novel differentially expressed miRNA biomarkers distinguishing NC from five dementia subtypes. Incorporating these miRNAs into ML classifiers resulted in up to a 27% improvement in dementia risk prediction. Pathway analysis highlighted neuronal and eye disease pathways associated with dementia risk. Sex-specific analyses revealed unique biomarkers for males and females, with miR-128-1-5 as a protective factor for males in AD, VaD, and DLB, and miR-4488 as a risk factor for female AD, highlighting distinct pathways and potential therapeutic targets for each sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support existing dementia etiology research and introduce new potential and sex-specific miRNA biomarkers.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
39822285,Blood phosphorylated Tau181 reliably differentiates amyloid-positive from amyloid-negative subjects in the Alzheimer's disease continuum: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers seem promising for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the potential of blood phosphorylated Tau181 (p-tau181) to differentiate amyloid-positive (A+) and amyloid-negative (A-) subjects. Two meta-analyses were conducted, showing the mean p-tau values in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the A+ and A- group, and the second comparing the mean p-tau concentrations in blood and CSF among A+ versus A- participants, by laboratory assessment method. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (2764 A+ and 5646 A- subjects) were included. The single-group meta-analysis showed mean higher blood p-tau181 values in the A+ than in the A- group. In the head-to-head meta-analysis, blood p-tau reliably differentiated A+ patients from A- participants. DISCUSSION: Regardless of the laboratory technique, blood p-tau181 reliably differentiates A+ and A- subjects. Therefore, it might have important applications for early diagnosis and inclusion in clinical trials for AD patients. HIGHLIGHTS: The role of blood-based biomarkers in discriminating AD patients is still uncertain.Blood p-tau181 distinguishes among amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative subjects.Blood p-tau181 might allow early diagnosis and inclusion in clinical trials.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"

39941381,Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers and Neuropsychological Abnormalities in Dementia: A Monocentric Study of Consecutive Patients.,"Background: In search of indicators for dementia, this study investigated the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuropsychological test results with disease stage in patients with early manifestations of dementia. Methods: In 190 consecutive patients with symptoms of dementia, the CSF parameters amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ1-42), phosphorylated tau protein (pTau), total tau protein (tTau), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), protein S100B (S100B), and Aβ (1-42)/(1-40) ratio (Aβ ratio), as well as the results of the CERAD-Plus test battery supplemented by the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the median duration of reported symptom onset. Results: Most prominent in the early phase of the disease were the relationships between Aβ1-42 and neuropsychological memory subtests, which were absent in the later phase. Less pronounced relationships to memory function were detectable for Aβ ratio and pTau. Conclusions: The results substantiate the relevance of Aβ1-42 for memory deficits and support the amyloid cascade hypothesis for Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Our data suggest other pathomechanisms for visuospatial impairments in AD.",Journal of clinical medicine
40034524,Neuropsychological and clinical indicators of Lewy body and Alzheimer's pathology.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) poses significant challenges due to pathological comorbidity. Similar ages of onset and overlapping cognitive and psychiatric symptoms can lead to diagnostic inaccuracy and inappropriate treatment recommendations. OBJECTIVE: Identify the best combination of clinical and neuropsychological predictors of AD, DLB, and mixed DLB/AD neuropathology in dementia patients. METHODS: Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we selected either pure AD (n = 189), DLB (n = 21), or mixed DLB/AD (n = 42) patients on autopsy. Neuropsychological and clinical predictors, including core clinical features of DLB, were entered into multivariable logistic regressions. RESULTS: Gait disturbances (odds ratio (OR) = 19.32; p = 0.01), visual-spatial complaints (OR = 6.06; p = 0.03), and visual hallucinations (OR = 31.06; p = 0.002) predicted DLB compared to AD, along with better memory (OR = 3.42; p = 0.003), naming (OR = 3.35; p = 0.002), and worse processing speed (OR = 0.51; p = 0.01). When comparing DLB to DLB/AD, gait disturbances (OR = 6.33; p = 0.01), increased depressive symptoms (OR = 1.44; p = 0.03), and better memory (OR = 3.01; p = 0.004) predicted DLB. Finally, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (OR = 6.44; p = 0.004), parkinsonism severity (OR = 1.07; p = 0.02), and lower depressive symptoms (OR = 0.70; p = 0.006) and memory impairment (OR = 0.57; p = 0.02) distinguished DLB/AD from AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study converges with prior research suggesting specific neuropsychological and clinical features can help distinguish DLB from AD. Neuropsychological differentiation becomes more challenging among mixed pathologies and in advanced cognitive impairment, although the presence of RBD and parkinsonism distinguished DLB. Earlier clinical assessment and incorporation of in vivo and postmortem biomarkers should enhance diagnostic accuracy and understanding of disease characteristics, offering significant relevance for disease-modifying treatments.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
39996033,Plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency as a potential predictor for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia: Findings from the GMCII cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the association between plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ) and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and determine its predictive value for outcomes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Plasma from 727 subjects (286 AD, 260 MCI, and 181 controls) in a case registry was analyzed using the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma OAβ. RESULTS: Elevated plasma OAβ was strongly correlated with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD. Patients with MCI with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrated a higher risk of progressing to dementia (hazard ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.137). Baseline plasma OAβ effectively predicted MCI-dementia conversion (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.824, 95% CI 0.752-0.897). DISCUSSION: The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma OAβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: We recruit study participants of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal controls in a case registry.We use the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ).We observe that elevated plasma OAβ strongly correlates with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD.MCI individuals with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrate a higher risk of progressing to dementia.The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma Oaβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from MCI to dementia.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"

40104524,A Phase IIa clinical trial to evaluate the effects of anti-retroviral therapy in Alzheimer's disease (ART-AD).,"Retrotransposons constitute over 40% of the human genome. Studies in Drosophila, mice, cultured cells, and human brain show that retrotransposons are activated in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, and causally drive neurodegeneration. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3TC (lamivudine) reduces retrotransposon activation and suppresses tau neurotoxicity among model systems. This phase 2a open-label trial (Pilot Study to Investigate the Safety and Feasibility of Anti-Retroviral Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease, NCT04552795, registered 09/10/2020) followed 12 participants with early Alzheimer's disease (MMSE > 24, CDR = 0.5) over 24 weeks to assess safety, tolerability, and feasibility of daily 300 mg 3TC treatment. The sample was well-educated (12-20 years) and culturally diverse (25% from underrepresented groups). In addition to a favorable safety profile and stable cognitive measures, notable significant changes in fluid-based biomarkers include reduction of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (P = 0.03) in CSF, suggestive of reduced neuroinflammation, and elevation of Aβ42/40 (P = 0.009) in plasma, suggestive of reduced plaque load in the brain. These results warrant further exploration in a larger, placebo-controlled trial.",NPJ dementia
40454424,Virtual Data Collection Strategies in Research on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Remote data collection emerged as a valuable method for engaging vulnerable populations, such as individuals participating in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research. Despite challenges like technology readiness and privacy concerns, remote methods have the potential to enhance participation among diverse groups by offering flexibility while addressing accessibility barriers such as geographic distance. This study shares experiences with virtual data collection and the strategies employed to enhance ADRD research involving individuals with and at risk of cognitive impairment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Experiences are drawn from RIDE (Recruitment Innovations for Diversity Enhancement), an online survey study to assess interest in ADRD research participation among presumably unimpaired adults identifying as Black or African American; and PARADE (Patient and Family Member Reactions to Biomarker-Informed ADRD Diagnoses), an observational, longitudinal cohort study of individuals receiving a biomarker-informed diagnosis for cognitive impairment and their care partners. We detail approaches employed across recruitment, data collection, to retention stages. RESULTS: Virtual data collection was highly feasible in both studies, successfully engaging participants in ADRD research, including those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. In RIDE, although project staff occasionally needed to troubleshoot technical challenges (e.g., broken survey links, video issues), the study successfully recruited 500 adults identifying as Black/African American. PARADE showed that synchronous interviews minimized missing data, with care partners providing essential technical and logistical support. Despite occasional difficulties with video conferencing and participant payments, most participants remained fully engaged, highlighting the effectiveness of virtual methods and the need for continuous support to ensure successful participation. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Virtual data collection offers opportunities to promote inclusion in ADRD research, as demonstrated by the successful enrollment of diverse participant samples in both studies. Successful implementation requires careful planning to address challenges such as digital literacy, educational disparities, and technical support.",Innovation in aging
39817194,Cognitive and Alzheimer's disease biomarker effects of oral nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation in older adults with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Age-associated depletion in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) concentrations has been implicated in metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. Supplementation with NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), offers a potential therapeutic avenue against neurodegenerative pathologies in aging, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias. A crossover, double-blind, randomized placebo (PBO) controlled trial was conducted to test the safety and efficacy of 8 weeks' active treatment with NR (1 g/day) on cognition and plasma AD biomarkers in older adults with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: The primary efficacy outcome was the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Secondary outcomes included plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau(217)), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Exploratory outcomes included Lumosity gameplay (z-scores) for cognition and step counts from wearables. Mixed model for repeated measures was used for between-group comparisons; paired t-tests were used for within-individual comparisons. RESULTS: Forty-six participants aged over 55 were randomized to NR-PBO or PBO-NR groups; 41 completed baseline visits, and 37 completed the trial. NR supplementation was safe and well tolerated with no differences in adverse events reported between NR and PBO treatment phases. For the between-group comparison, there was a 7% reduction in pTau(217) concentrations after taking NR, while an 18% increase with PBO (p = 0.02). No significant between-group differences were observed for RBANS, other plasma biomarkers(GFAP and NfL), Lumosity gameplay scores or step counts. For the within-individual comparison, pTau(217) concentrations significantly decreased during the NR phase compared to the PBO (p = 0.02), while step counts significantly increased during the NR phase than PBO (p = 0.04). DISCUSSION: Eight weeks NR supplementation is safe and lowered pTau(217) concentrations but did not alter cognition as measured by conventional or novel digital assessments. Further research is warranted to validate NR's efficacy in altering pathological brain aging processes. HIGHLIGHTS: The integrated study design combines a two-arm parallel trial with a crossover phase, offering the opportunity to enhance sample size for within-individual analysis and assess carryover effects.NR is safe but did not alter cognition as measured by multi-modal assessments in SCD/MCI.For between-group comparison, pTau(217) levels decreased with NR and increased with PBO at 8-week follow-up.For within-individual comparison, step counts increased after NR and decreased after PBO.A larger, longer study with pharmacodynamic and pathophysiological biomarkers is needed to assess NR's disease-modifying effects.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39811702,Identifying cognitive test scores associated with early tau burden in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to identify cognitive tests that optimally relate to tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), a neocortical region associated with early tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the harvard aging brain study (HABS) (n = 128) and the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study (n = 393). We used elastic net regression to identify the most robust cognitive correlates of tau PET signal in the ITC. Secondary analyses examined whether the cognitive correlates remained significantly associated with tau after adjusting for structural brain measures. RESULTS: Episodic memory measures, including both total and ""process"" scores, were the most robust correlates of ITC tau across both cohorts. These cognitive test scores remained significant after accounting for structural brain measures. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of specific episodic memory test scores to detect and monitor neuropathological changes associated with early AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning identified cognitive correlates of early Alzheimer's disease tau burden.Both traditional and process scores predicted early tau burden.Episodic memory scores were among the strongest correlates.Cognitive scores remained significant after accounting for structural brain measures.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39822298,Clinical decision points for two plasma p-tau217 laboratory developed tests in neuropathology confirmed samples.,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of two commercial plasma p-tau217 immunoassays compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and neuropathology. METHODS: One hundred and seventy plasma samples from the University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimer's (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard. RESULTS: Fujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy findings, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath area under the curve [AUC] = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC = 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay. DISCUSSION: Our study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay-specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: Two commercially available p-tau217 immunoassays (ALZpath and Fujirebio) showed equal performance based on CSF testing.ALZpath p-tau217 showed higher performance compared to Fujirebio p-tau217 based on AD diagnosis by neuropathology confirmation.Specific plasma p-tau217 assays may require distinct decision points for AD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression monitoring.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40008329,Amyloid-β deposition predicts oscillatory slowing of magnetoencephalography signals and a reduction of functional connectivity over time in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"With the ongoing developments in the field of anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer's disease, it is crucial to better understand the longitudinal associations between amyloid-β deposition and altered network activity in the living human brain. We included 110 cognitively unimpaired individuals (67.9 ± 5.7 years), who underwent [(18)F]flutemetamol (amyloid-β)-PET imaging and resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording at baseline and 4-year follow-up. We tested associations between baseline amyloid-β deposition and MEG measures (oscillatory power and functional connectivity). Next, we examined the relationship between baseline amyloid-β deposition and longitudinal MEG measures, as well as between baseline MEG measures and longitudinal amyloid-β deposition. Finally, we assessed associations between longitudinal changes in both amyloid-β deposition and MEG measures. Analyses were performed using linear mixed models corrected for age, sex and family. At baseline, amyloid-β deposition in orbitofrontal-posterior cingulate regions (i.e. early Alzheimer's disease regions) was associated with higher theta (4-8 Hz) power (β = 0.17, P < 0.01) in- and lower functional connectivity [inverted Joint Permutation Entropy (JPE(inv)) theta, β = -0.24, P < 0.001] of these regions, lower whole-brain beta (13-30 Hz) power (β = -0.13, P < 0.05) and lower whole-brain functional connectivity (JPE(inv) theta, β = -0.18, P < 0.001). Whole-brain amyloid-β deposition was associated with higher whole-brain theta power (β = 0.17, P < 0.05), lower whole-brain beta power (β = -0.13, P < 0.05) and lower whole-brain functional connectivity (JPE(inv) theta, β = -0.21, P < 0.001). Baseline amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions also predicted future oscillatory slowing, reflected by increased theta power over time in early Alzheimer's disease regions and across the whole brain (β = 0.11, β = 0.08, P < 0.001), as well as decreased whole-brain beta power over time (β = -0.04, P < 0.05). Baseline amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions also predicted a reduction in functional connectivity between these regions and the rest of the brain over time (JPE(inv) theta, β = -0.07, P < 0.05). Baseline whole-brain amyloid-β deposition was associated with increased whole-brain theta power over time (β = 0.08, P < 0.01). Baseline MEG measures were not associated with longitudinal amyloid-β deposition. Longitudinal changes in amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions were associated with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of early Alzheimer's disease regions (JPE(inv) theta, β = -0.19, P < 0.05) and the whole brain [corrected amplitude envelope correlations alpha (8-13 Hz), β = -0.22, P < 0.05]. Finally, longitudinal changes in whole-brain amyloid-β deposition were associated with longitudinal changes in whole-brain relative theta power (β = 0.21, P < 0.05). Disruptions of oscillatory power and functional connectivity appear to represent early functional consequences of emerging amyloid-β deposition in cognitively unimpaired individuals. These findings suggest a role for neurophysiology in monitoring disease progression and potential treatment effects in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease.",Brain communications
40584180,Infections with Chlamydia pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. METHODS: This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. DISCUSSION: Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39834700,Feasibility and potential diagnostic value of [(18)F]PI-2620 PET in patients with down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease: a case series.,"PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Adults with Down Syndrome (DS) have a substantially increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the triplicated amyloid-precursor-protein gene on chromosome 21, resulting in amyloid and tau accumulation. However, tau PET assessments are not sufficiently implemented in DS-AD research or clinical work-up, and second-generation tau tracers such as [(18)F]PI-2620 have not been thoroughly characterized in adults with DS. We aim at illustrating feasibility and potential diagnostic value of tau PET imaging with [(18)F]PI-2620 for the diagnosis of DS-AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five adults with DS (40% female, aged 43-62) and cognitive decline underwent clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing, lumbar puncture and multimodal neuroimaging. All underwent [(18)F]PI-2620 tau PET. Visual read of tau PET scans was performed by three blinded raters, assessing increased tracer uptake in brain areas corresponding to the six Braak stage regions and basal ganglia. RESULTS: Visual read of tau burden revealed three tau-positive individuals which corresponded to their clinical decline while two cognitively stable individuals were rated as negative. Rating showed high inter-rater reliability for all Braak stages. CONCLUSION: Tau PET imaging is a feasible and important biomarker assessment in the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline in adults with DS at risk of developing AD.",Frontiers in neuroscience

39779882,Consuming a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet reverses the peripheral lipid signature of Alzheimer's disease in humans.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder with significant environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, influencing its onset and progression. Although previous studies have suggested that certain diets may reduce the incidence of AD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHOD: In this post-hoc analysis of a randomized crossover study of 20 elderly adults, we investigated the effects of a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on the plasma lipidome in the context of AD biomarkers, analyzing 784 lipid species across 47 classes using a targeted lipidomics platform. RESULTS: Here we identified substantial changes in response to MMKD intervention, aside from metabolic changes associated with a ketogenic diet, we identified a a global elevation across all plasmanyl and plasmenyl ether lipid species, with many changes linked to clinical and biochemical markers of AD. We further validated our findings by leveraging our prior clinical studies into lipid related changeswith AD (n = 1912), and found that the lipidomic signature with MMKD was inversely associated with the lipidomic signature of prevalent and incident AD. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention with a MMKD was able to alter the plasma lipidome in ways that contrast with AD-associated patterns. Given its low risk and cost, MMKD could be a promising approach for prevention or early symptomatic treatment of AD.",Communications medicine
40303469,Leukocyte telomere attrition in cognitive decline: associations with APOE genotype and cardiovascular risk factors.,"Telomere shortening represents a fundamental mechanism of cellular aging potentially implicated in neurodegenerative processes. This study investigated the complex associations among leukocyte telomere length, cardiovascular risk profiles, and APOE polymorphisms in age-related cognitive decline. Through a cross-sectional analysis of 90 participants stratified by cognitive status into three groups: cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we quantified relative telomere length using quantitative PCR, performed APOE genotyping and assessed cardiovascular risk factors. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly reduced telomere length in the AD group compared to CU and MCI groups. Multivariate regression analysis identified cognitive status as an independent predictor of telomere length (β = -0.468, p < 0.001). APOE ε4 carrier status showed higher prevalence in AD subjects as expected. Cardiovascular risk factors demonstrated no significant correlation with telomere length across cognitive groups. Our findings establish a robust association between telomere shortening and advanced cognitive impairment in AD, suggesting potential utility as a neurodegenerative biomarker. This relationship appears independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, highlighting the complexity of cellular aging mechanisms in neurodegeneration.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and cost-effective technique commonly used in the study of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the specific alterations in EEG biomarkers associated with AD remain unclear when using a limited number of electrodes. METHODS: We studied pathological characteristics of AD using low-density EEG data collected from 26 AD and 29 healthy controls (HC) during both eye closed (EC) and eye opened (EO) resting conditions. The analysis including power spectrum, phase lock value (PLV), and weighted lag phase index (wPLI) and power-to-power frequency coupling (theta/beta) analysis were applied to extract features in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. RESULTS: During the EC condition, the AD group exhibited decreased alpha power compared to HC. Additionally, both analysis of PLV and wPLI in the theta band indicated that the alterations in the AD brain network predominantly involved in the frontal region with the opposite changes. Moreover, the AD group had increased frequency coupling in the frontal and central regions. Surprisingly, no group difference was found in the EO condition. Notably, decreased theta band functional connectivity within the fronto-central lobe and increased frequency coupling in frontal region were found in AD group from EC to EO. More importantly, the combination of EC and EO quantitative EEG features improved the inter-group classification accuracy when using support vector machine (SVM) in older adults with AD. These findings highlight the complementary nature of EC and EO conditions in assessing and differentiating AD cohorts. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the potential of utilizing low-density EEG data from resting-state paradigms, combined with machine learning techniques, to improve the identification and classification of AD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39997032,CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cell Counts in Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"PURPOSE: To assess the presence and quantity of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of the databases identified the observational and interventional studies reporting baseline CD34+ cell counts in AD patients. The data on mean counts and the measures of variation were extracted. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated using common and random effects models to compare the CD34+ cell counts between the AD patients and controls. Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated using tau(2), tau, and I(2) statistics. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the ROBINS-I tool. PATIENTS: Five studies were included, comprising four observational studies and one open-label trial, with a total of 271 participants (139 AD patients and 132 controls). RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated an increase in CD34+ cell counts of the AD patients when compared to the controls. The common effects model showed a moderate SMD of 0.2964 (95% CI:0.0490-0.5437). However, the random effects model yielded a non-significant SMD of 0.2326 (95% CI: -0.4832-0.9484). Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I(2) = 87.1%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: AD patients may exhibit higher circulating CD34+ cell counts than the controls, but substantial heterogeneity and potential biases limit definitive conclusions.","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)"
40256257,Comparative analysis of white matter signal alterations in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Lewy body diseases (LBD) include neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Because DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share similar neurological symptoms, DLB is frequently underdiagnosed. White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with dementia risk and changes in both DLB and AD. In order to examine WMH discrepancies in DLB and AD patients and gain insight into their diagnostic utility and pathophysiological significance, this systematic review and meta-analysis is conducted. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting WMH in DLB and AD patients based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review (PRISMA) guideline. Stata version 15 US is used to analyze the extracted data. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 906 AD and 499 DLB patients were considered in this analysis. Although not statistically significant, the WMH was 0.03 ml larger in AD patients than in DLB patients. The prevalence of hypertension varied, ranging from 21% to 56% in DLB patients and from 30% to 52% in AD patients. Different findings were found on the prevalence of diabetes; some research suggested that DLB patients had greater rates (18.7%-37%) than AD patients (9%-17.5%). The imaging modalities FLAIR, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted sequences were employed. Compared to DLB patients, AD patients had higher cortical and infratentorial infarcts. CONCLUSION: Those with AD have greater WMH volumes than cases with DLB, suggesting that WMH can be a biomarker to help better differentiation between these neurodegenerative diseases; however, this difference is not significant. To better understand the therapeutic implications and options for reducing WMH-related cognitive loss in various patient populations, more research is necessary.",Frontiers in radiology
40574977,The potential dual role of tau phosphorylation: plasma phosphorylated-tau217 in newborns and Alzheimer's disease.,"Tau phosphorylation plays an important role in brain physiology and pathology. During foetal development, it supports microtubule dynamics and neuroplasticity, whereas in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it drives pathological tau aggregation and tangle formation. In this multicentre study (n = 462), we measured plasma phosphorylated-tau217 in healthy newborns, premature infants, patients with AD and healthy controls across various age groups. Plasma phosphorylated-tau217 levels were significantly higher in newborns compared to healthy individuals of any age group and even exceeded levels observed in patients with AD. In newborns, plasma phosphorylated-tau217 levels inversely correlated with perinatal factors such as gestational age. Longitudinal analysis of preterm infants demonstrated a decline in serum phosphorylated-tau217 levels over the first months of life, approaching levels observed in young adults. In contrast, elevated plasma phosphorylated-tau217 in older individuals was associated with AD pathology. Our findings corroborate the crucial role of tau phosphorylation in early brain development. However, in AD, tau phosphorylation transitions into a pathological mechanism. The high levels of blood-based phosphorylated-tau217 observed at birth and subsequent clearance might indicate distinct regulatory mechanisms that prevent tau aggregation in early life. Further studies are needed to explore the shared mechanisms of tau phosphorylation in newborns and AD.",Brain communications
39949872,Assessing the clinical meaningfulness of slowing CDR-SB progression with disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: For many patients and caregivers, a major goal of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is to extend independence in instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADLs and BADLs). The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of treatments on the time remaining independent in IADLs and BADLs. METHODS: Participants at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) who met eligibility criteria for recent DMT trials were studied: age ≥60 years at baseline, clinical diagnosis of very mild or mild AD dementia (global Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score 0.5 or 1), biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology, and at least one follow-up CDR assessment within 5 years. For IADLs, a subset of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) was examined that rated the degree of independence in the following: paying bills, driving, remembering medications and appointments, and preparing meals. For BADLs, the Personal Care domain of the CDR was used. Mixed-effects logistic and ordinal regression models were used to examine the relationship between CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and the individual functional outcomes and their components. The change in CDR-SB over time was estimated with linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 282 participants were followed for an average of 2.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.3 years). For 50% of individuals, loss of independence in IADLs occurred at CDR-SB >4.5 and in BADLs at CDR-SB >11.5. For individuals with a baseline CDR-SB = 2, treatment with lecanemab would extend independence in IADLs for 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4-18 months) and treatment with donanemab in the low/medium tau group would extend independence in IADLs by 13 months (95% CI 6-24 months). DISCUSSION: Independence in ADLs can be related to CDR-SB and used to demonstrate the effect of AD treatments in extending the time of independent function, a meaningful outcome for patients and their families. HIGHLIGHTS: We estimated time to loss of independence for people with AD dementiaEstimating time to loss of independence can help with clinical decision-makingDisease-modifying treatments for AD dementia can extend independence.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39791681,The Beneficial Effects of Lactobacillus Strains on Gut Microbiome in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence suggests that the gut-brain axis influences brain function, particularly the role of intestinal microbiota in modulating cognitive processes. Probiotics may alter brain function and behavior by modulating gut microbiota, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this review is to systematically review the current literature exploring the effects of probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota and cognitive function in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Scopus to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to 20 August 2024. The search focused on comparing outcomes between intervention and control/placebo groups. Data searches, article selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no: CRD42023446796. RESULTS: Data from four RCTs involving 293 Individuals (AD and MCI patients) receiving mainly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains showed some beneficial effects on cognitive function, altered gut microbiota composition, and positively affected metabolic biomarkers. However, variability in microbiota assessment across studies limits the interpretation of results. The limited number and quality of the existing studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the data. Additional high-quality research is clearly needed. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics show promise as an adjunctive intervention for cognitive decline, but larger, long-term trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and clinical applicability in neurodegenerative diseases like AD.","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)"
39816189,Brain aging rejuvenation factors in adults with genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disease.,"The largest risk factor for dementia is age. Heterochronic blood exchange studies have uncovered age-related blood factors that demonstrate 'pro-aging' or 'pro-youthful' effects on the mouse brain. The clinical relevance and combined effects of these factors for humans is unclear. We examined five previously identified brain rejuvenation factors in cerebrospinal fluid of adults with autosomal dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Our frontotemporal dementia cohort included 100 observationally followed adults carrying autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia mutations (M(age) = 49.6; 50% female; 43% C9orf72, 24% GRN, 33% MAPT) and 62 non-carriers (M(age) = 52.6; 45% female) with cerebrospinal fluid analysed on Somascan, and longitudinal (M(visits) = 3 years, range 1-7 years) neuropsychological and functional assessments and plasma neurofilament light chain. Our Alzheimer's disease cohort included 35 adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (M(age) = 69.4; 60% female) and 56 controls (M(age) = 68.8, 50% female) who completed the same cerebrospinal fluid and clinical outcome measures cross-sectionally. Levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, beta-2-micorglobulin, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (aka Osteocalcin) and colony stimulating factor 2 in cerebrospinal fluid were linearly combined into a composite score, with higher values reflecting 'pro-youthful' levels. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, higher baseline cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins predicted slower decline across cognitive, functional, and neurofilament light chain trajectories; estimates were similar across genotypes. In transdiagnostic analyses, higher cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins associated with better functional, cognitive, and neurofilament light chain outcomes in adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Proteins with pre-clinical evidence for brain rejuvenation show translational clinical relevance in adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and warrant further investigation.",Brain communications
39935341,Prevalence of subjective cognitive decline and its association with physical health problems among urban community dwelling elderly population in South India.,"INTRODUCTION: No studies in India have explored subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a hallmark of stage II of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to assess the prevalence and correlates of SCD in a South Indian, urban, elderly population. METHODS: We screened 403 individuals 60 years of age and older using the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ) and measured objective cognition with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physical health parameters were evaluated for all participants. RESULTS: Among the participants, 377 (93.5%) reported subjective memory complaints. Of the 26 individuals without SCD, 15(57.7%) had objective cognitive impairment (MoCA <25). A total of 182 participants (45.2%) were identified with SCD. Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with fewer SCD reports and better cognitive performance (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is highly prevalent among older adults. Screening for SCD can help identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. SCD assessement combined with cost-effective biomarkers that confirms AD will help individuals to be identified for disease-modifying therapies. HIGHLIGHTS: Nearly half of older adults population screened has reported subjective cognitive decline (SCD), highlighting the widespread occurrence of SCD in urban South India. Participants with higher educational attainment had significantly fewer memory complaints and performed better on cognitive assessments. SCD was prevalent even among individuals without major comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension and those who were on regular treatment for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Identifying subjective cognitive decline (SCD) can facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of cognitive disorders and help delay progression to dementia. This highlights the importance of developing and implementing improved public health strategies to address these challenges. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to explore the progression of SCD to dementia, focusing on the interplay between cognitive health, biomarkers, and educational factors in the Indian population.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association

39865007,Gender differences in cognitive impairment among the elderly in rural West Texas counties.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in the elderly population has been increasing both nationally and globally. Males and females are impacted differently when it comes to cognitive health, and this can be influenced by various risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study highlights the sociodemographic, chronic disease, and genetic biomarker risk factors associated with gender differences and cognitive impairments in the elderly population living in Cochran, Parmer, and Bailey counties of rural West Texas. METHODS: Cross tabulation, Pearson's chi-squared, two sample proportions, binary logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression were utilized to analyze data. SPSS software was used to detect significant risk factors. RESULTS: Using a bivariate logistic regression, the age group 70 and above of males and females for the Cochran and Parmer counties was found significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Anxiety, depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment in females in Parmer County. Gender differences were observed in Cochran County for smoking but females in Bailey County were found to be more tobacco-dependent compared to other counties. However, in Cochran County the prevalence of cognitive impairment with rates of 66% for males and 70% for females was observed to be significantly lower in hypertensive group who consumed modified diet. CONCLUSIONS: Gender-based disparities in cognitive impairment are essential for gaining more insights into Alzheimer's disease or dementia prevention and advancement of healthcare and medical approaches in the underserved rural communities of West Texas.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
39440770,Oxidative Stress-mediated Lipid Peroxidation-derived Lipid Aldehydes in the Pathophysiology of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cause damage and gradual loss of neurons affecting the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases are most commonly seen in the ageing process. Ageing causes increased reactive oxygen species and decreased mitochondrial ATP generation, resulting in redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress-generated free radicals cause damage to membrane lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to the formation of toxic lipid aldehyde products such as 4- hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde. Several studies have shown that lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde products form adducts with cellular proteins, altering their structure and function. Thus, these lipid aldehydes could act as secondary signaling intermediates, modifying important metabolic pathways, and contributing to the pathophysiology of several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, they could serve as biomarkers for disease progression. This narrative review article discusses the biological and clinical significance of oxidative stress-mediated lipid peroxidation-derived lipid aldehydes in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases.",Current neuropharmacology
40171172,Perinatal asphyxia and Alzheimer's disease: is there a correlation?,"The perinatal development period is critical for the formation of brain structures responsible for cognitive functions. Disruptions during this phase, such as perinatal asphyxia, characterized by impaired gas exchange and hypoxia, can lead to long-lasting neuronal damage and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, the most common cause of dementia globally, is marked by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and progressive cognitive decline. Emerging evidence links perinatal asphyxia with an elevated risk of AD, highlighting the potential role of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and epigenetic modifications as mediators. This review explores the mechanisms underlying brain damage after perinatal asphyxia, emphasizing oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic changes that contribute to lifelong neurodegenerative susceptibility. Additionally, biomarkers identified in animal models reveal parallels between perinatal asphyxia and AD pathology, such as amyloid precursor protein alterations, gliosis, and microglial activation. These findings suggest perinatal asphyxia may prime microglia and epigenetically alter gene expression, predisposing individuals to chronic neurodegeneration. Future research should leverage advanced methodologies, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, and aged brain organoid models, to elucidate early-life influences on AD development. Understanding these mechanisms may pave the way for novel prevention strategies targeting early-life risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in pediatrics
40352958,Potential Value of Plasma-Based Biomarkers for Prediction of Episodic Memory Performance and Identification of Individuals with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are thought to be highly susceptible to developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to investigate the possibilities of plasma-biomarkers for individual patient identification of aMCI and prediction of episodic memory. METHODS: We recruited 87 healthy controls and 68 aMCI patients in this study; and 22/68 aMCI patients completed 3-year follow-up visits, with six aMCI patients converting to AD. An ultrasensitive quantitative method was employed to measure the levels of plasma biomarkers. RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, the aMCI patients showed significantly higher levels of plasma neurofilament light (NfL) and lower levels of plasma Aβ40, Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (all P values <0.01). Using multivariate relevance vector regression models, we further demonstrated plasma biomarkers could accurately predict baseline Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test-20 min delayed recall (AVLT-DR) scores (r = 0.362, P value <0.001) and 3-year longitudinal AVLT-DR changes (r = 0.365, P value <0.001) for individual aMCI patients; plasma-indicators contributed most to the predictions including total-tau and NfL. Finally, by using support vector machine model, the combination of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, and hippocampal/parahippocampal volume had the highest accuracy of 77.42% (sensitivity = 72.06%, specificity = 81.61%) for identifying aMCI patients. CONCLUSION: We provided support to the use of plasma total-tau and NfL as simple biomarkers to predict the severity of episodic memory deficit for individual aMCI patients and aMCI progression, and further demonstrated that the combination of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, hippocampal/parahippocampal volume, and MMSE score could serve as an integrated screening tool to select aMCI individuals.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment
40370658,Cognitive impairment and vulnerability of cholinergic brain network in the Alzheimer's continuum: free-water imaging based on diffusion tensor imaging.,"BACKGROUND: Increased extracellular free water (FW) is considered to provide better pathophysiological information than conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics. The cholinergic brain network is a key hub for cognitive function, and microstructural changes detected by free water imaging in this system may be associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific impact of FW changes in the cholinergic brain network on cognitive domains across the AD continuum and their diagnostic value remain unclear. METHODS: Here, we investigated the basal forebrain cholinergic free water alterations based on free water-corrected diffusion tensor imaging in healthy controls (n = 36), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n = 31), the AD group (n = 33). The cholinergic basal forebrain subregions were divided into the Broca diagonal band (Ch1-3) and the Meynert basal nucleus (Ch4). The cognitive domains performance was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic value of free water fraction (FWf) within the cholinergic system. RESULTS: FWf in the bilateral Ch1-3 and Ch4 regions increased with age, and was significantly higher in aMCI and AD (p < 0.001). In AD, the FWf within Ch4 was correlated with total MoCA score (R = -0.42, p = 0.015), especially with visual spatial/executive (R = -0.47, p = 0.006) and orientation deficits (R = -0.38, p = 0.029). No significant correlations were found in the aMCI group. ROC curve analysis showed that FWf within the cholinergic brain network had high diagnostic efficacy for AD versus HC (AUC = 0.958, 95% CI = 0.909-1.00), and moderate diagnostic efficacy for aMCI versus HC (AUC = 0.795, 95% CI = 0.685-0.905) and aMCI versus AD (AUC = 0.719, 95% CI = 0.589-0.850). CONCLUSION: FW imaging captures microstructural damage in the cholinergic brain network across the entire AD continuum. These changes occur early in aMCI but selectively affect domain-specific cognition in the later stages of AD, possibly through cholinergic network dysfunction. Our results highlight the potential of free water imaging as a biomarker for cognitive decline.",Frontiers in neuroscience
40370762,Exploring the link between GLP-1 receptor agonists and dementia: A comprehensive review.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), originally developed for glycemic control, are emerging as neuroprotective agents. This review evaluates the evidence regarding the effects of GLP-1RAs in populations with T2DM-both with and without cognitive impairment, as well as in individuals diagnosed with AD. We conducted a comprehensive literature search and identified ten studies for inclusion: six randomized controlled trials, one prospective open-label study, and three observational studies. GLP-1RAs consistently demonstrated cognitive benefits in patients with T2DM, even in the absence of metabolic improvements. In cases of early dementia or AD, GLP-1RA treatment preserved brain metabolism and connectivity but did not significantly alter amyloid or tau biomarkers. Notably, cognitive improvements were most evident in individuals with higher body mass index (BMI) or obesity. While some studies reported neural functional changes via imaging, direct modifications in established AD biomarkers were not consistently observed. In conclusion, GLP-1RAs may improve cognitive outcomes and brain function, particularly in the early stages of neurodegeneration and among high-risk T2DM populations. Further well-designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate the impacts of GLP-1RAs on both the clinical progression and underlying pathology of dementia.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
40051735,MRI detects blood-brain barrier alterations in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease and lung infection.,"Pneumonia is a common infection in people suffering with Alzheimer's disease, leading to delirium, critical illness or severe neurological decline, which may be due to an amplified response of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to peripheral insult. We assess the response of the BBB to repeated Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection in rat model of Alzheimer's disease (TgF344-AD), at 13- and 18-months old, using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and filter exchange imaging. Higher BBB water exchange rate is initially detected in infected TgF344-AD rats. BBB water exchange rates correlated with hippocampus aquaporin-4 water channel expression in infected animals. We detected no differences in BBB permeability to gadolinium contrast agent measured by DCE-MRI, confirmed by staining for tight junction proteins, occludin and claudin-5. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of how peripheral inflammation impacts the BBB.",Npj imaging..
39887533,Plasma proteomic characterization of motoric cognitive risk and mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) is a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by mobility and cognitive dysfunction. This study conducted a proteome-wide study of MCR and compared the proteomic signatures of MCR to that of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Participants were classified as MCR using a memory questionnaire and 4-meter walk. We measured 4877 plasma proteins collected during late-life and midlife. Multivariable logistic regression related each protein to late-life MCR/MCI. MCR-associated proteins were replicated internally at midlife and in an external cohort. RESULTS: Proteome-wide analysis (n = 4076) identified 25 MCR-associated proteins. Eight of these proteins remained associated with late-life MCR when measured during midlife. Two proteins (SVEP1 and TAGLN) were externally replicated. Compared to MCI, MCR had a distinct and much stronger proteomic signature enriched for cardiometabolic and immune pathways. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the divergent biology underlying two pre-dementia syndromes. Metabolic and immune dysfunction may be a primary driver of MCR. HIGHLIGHTS: MCR is defined by concurrent cognitive and gait dysfunction. MCR protein biomarkers have key roles in cardiometabolic and vascular function. MCR biomarkers are also associated with cerebrovascular disease and dementia. MCR and MCI demonstrate overlapping but divergent proteomic signatures.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39763110,Porous Materials for Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, present formidable challenges in modern medicine due to their complex pathologies and the absence of curative treatments. Despite advances in symptomatic management, early diagnosis remains essential for mitigating disease progression and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as MRI, PET, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, are often inadequate for the early detection of these diseases. Emerging porous materials, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), MXene, zeolites, and porous silicon, offer promising new approaches for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. These materials, characterized by highly tunable physicochemical properties, have the potential to capture and concentrate disease-specific biomarkers such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau protein, and alpha-synuclein (α-Syn). The integration of these materials into advanced biosensors for real-time detection holds the promise of revolutionizing neurodiagnostic, enabling non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific detection platforms. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques into the analysis of sensor data enhances diagnostic accuracy and allows for more efficient interpretation of complex biomarker profiles. AI and ML can optimize feature selection, improve pattern recognition, and facilitate the prediction of disease progression, making them indispensable tools for personalized medicine. This review explores the potential of porous materials in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics, emphasizing their design, functionality, and the synergistic role of AI and ML in advancing clinical applications.",Advanced healthcare materials
39614734,The detection of GRN mutation carriers by progranulin blood protein levels from finger-stick collection.,"INTRODUCTION: Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) leading to decreased progranulin levels are one of the most frequent causes of inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We evaluated progranulin levels in dried blood spots from capillary finger-stick collection (DBS(capillary)). METHODS: Paired venous Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma and DBS(capillary) samples were collected from each participant with or without pathogenic GRN mutations. RESULTS: DBS(capillary) progranulin levels in GRN mutation carriers (mean [SD] age, 55 [13] years; n = 16) were reduced compared to non-mutation carriers (64 [11] years; n = 44) (2.38 ng/mL [1.0] vs 4.37 [0.68] ng/mL; U = 42; p < 0.0001, ROC AUC = 0.94 [95% CI: 0.83 to 1.00]) and highly associated with venous plasma levels (R = 0.819; p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Progranulin levels can be accurately determined from finger-stick blood samples. This can enable regular and remote monitoring of this protein in FTD therapeutic trials and potentially serve as a first-level screening test for GRN mutations. HIGHLIGHTS: Progranulin levels measured using capillary dried blood spots were significantly reduced in GRN mutation carriers compared to non-mutation carriers. Progranulin levels measured using capillary dried blood spots strongly correlated with levels from venous EDTA plasma. DBS(capillary) progranulin levels were able to identify GRN mutation carriers with high accuracy. DBS(capillary) might allow repeated measurements of progranulin levels in a remote and unsupervised setting, circumventing the restrictions of traditional venous blood collection. DBS(capillary) might be used to assess the biological efficacy of disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials aiming to increase baseline progranulin levels or as a first-level screening for GRN mutations in primary settings.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39925924,Inflammatory and Redox Blood Gene Expression Fingerprint of Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in Patients With Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the sleep disorder most frequently found in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intermittent hypoxia (IH) caused by OSA may participate in AD pathogenesis through increase in oxidative damage and inflammation. We aimed to identify inflammatory and redox genes differentially expressed in the blood from AD patients with severe OSA compared with those with nonsevere OSA. METHODS: We included 40 AD patients diagnosed based on clinical manifestations and AD biomarker levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Severe or nonsevere OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index ≥ 30/h and < 30/h, respectively) was diagnosed through overnight polysomnography (PSG). The expression levels of 136 inflammation-related and 84 redox-related genes were evaluated by whole blood targeted transcriptomics. RESULTS: Three inflammatory and six redox genes were upregulated in the blood of AD patients with severe OSA. Three of them correlated with PSG parameters. A pathway enrichment analysis showed a strong enrichment of the serotonergic synapse pathway in severe OSA AD patients. DISCUSSION: Our results show an upregulation of nine genes involved in NF-κB-mediated inflammation and redox metabolism in the blood of patients with mild AD with severe OSA. Therefore, severe OSA may worsen the inflammation and oxidative damage that are already altered in patients with AD.",Journal of inflammation research

40135149,Cardiovascular rate pressure product is associated with NfL in older adults at risk for AD.,"INTRODUCTION: Elevated cardiovascular rate pressure product (RPP) has been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality and is associated with poor cognitive test performance among older adults. However, it is unclear how RPP is related to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. METHODS: RPP was cross-sectionally evaluated as a predictor of CSF biomarker levels in a cohort of 310 cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease. The primary outcomes were CSF levels of α-Synuclein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light (NfL), soluble triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2, and total tau. Further analyses examined amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), and pTau181/Aβ4. RESULTS: RPP was positively associated with NfL (β = 0.006, R (2) = 0.411, p = 0.012, but Bonferroni-corrected p ≤ 0.006) and not with other CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation investigated in this sample. DISCUSSION: A high myocardial oxygen demand at rest may be related to neuronal death and axonal degeneration in cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults. HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the relationship between RPP and CSF analytes.Higher RPP was associated with higher NfL but not other measured CSF biomarkers.HR was positively associated with NfL, whereas SBP was not.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39236931,Interplay of MeCP2/REST/Synaptophysin-BDNF and intranasal oxytocin influence on Aβ-induced memory and cognitive impairments.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to the accumulation of Aβ, increased tau hyperphosphorylation, persistent neuroinflammation, and a decline in neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Oxytocin (OT) has a significant impact on memory and learning. We examined the influence of intranasal (IN) OT on synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, histone acetylation, and spatial and cognitive memories in rats. METHODS: Aβ(25-35) (5 µg/2.5 µl) was administered bilaterally in the CA1 of male Wistar rats for four consecutive days. After seven days of recovery, OT (2 µg/µl, 10 µl in each nostril) was administered IN for seven consecutive days. Working, spatial, and cognitive memories, and gene expression of neurogenesis- and synaptic plasticity-involved factors were measured in the hippocampus. Histone acetylation (H3K9 and H4K8) was also measured using western blotting. RESULTS: IN administration of OT significantly improved working and spatial memory impairment induced by Aβ and increased the factors involved in synaptic plasticity (MeCP2, REST, synaptophysin, and BDNF) and neurogenesis (Ki67 and DCX). We also found an enhancement in the levels of H3K9ac and H4K8ac following OT administration. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that IN OT could improve hippocampus-related behaviors by increasing synaptic plasticity, stimulating neurogenesis, and chromatin plasticity.",Behavioural brain research
39749011,Diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia: blood plasma and optical coherence tomography.,"Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is crucial for enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers (neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau181) and retinal biomarkers (retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer), individually and in combination, in differentiating moderate cognitive impairment and dementia from mild cognitive impairment and no cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 509 participants, aged 50 and older, recruited from a memory clinic. The participants were categorized as normal (n = 100), mild cognitive impairment (n = 144), moderate cognitive impairment (n = 90) or dementia (n = 175) based on detailed clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing and MRI scans. The thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (P < 0.001) and retinal nerve fibre layer (P = 0.030) decreased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia. The thickest layers were observed in individuals with no cognitive impairment (mean ± standard deviation: ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 76 ± 11 µm, retinal nerve fibre layer: 92 ± 10 µm), while the thinnest layers were found in individuals with dementia (ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 72 ± 14 µm, retinal nerve fibre layer: 89 ± 12 µm). Plasma biomarker levels increased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia (P < 0.001). Levels were lowest in individuals with no cognitive impairment [median (interquartile range): neurofilament light chain: 15 (9) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 1.85 (1.00) pg/mL] and highest in those with dementia [neurofilament light chain: 34 (27) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 3.24 (2.81) pg/mL]. After adjusting for retinal scan signal strength, neurofilament light chain showed a stronger negative association with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [standardized beta estimate (β) = -0.184] and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (β = -0.139) compared to phosphorylated tau181, which exhibited weaker associations with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (β = -0.091) and retinal nerve fibre layer (β = -0.059). While retinal parameters provided modest discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.60), plasma biomarkers demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.76). Notably, neurofilament light chain had a stronger association with retinal thinning than phosphorylated tau181 and offered superior diagnostic value for identifying moderate cognitive decline. These findings underscore the potential of plasma biomarkers, particularly neurofilament light chain, for the early detection of dementia.",Brain communications
39789603,Neuropathological contributions to grey matter atrophy and white matter hyperintensities in amnestic dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Dementia patients commonly present multiple neuropathologies, worsening cognitive function, yet structural neuroimaging signatures of dementia have not been positioned in the context of combined pathology. In this study, we implemented an MRI voxel-based approach to explore combined and independent effects of dementia pathologies on grey and white matter structural changes. METHODS: In 91 amnestic dementia patients with post-mortem brain donation, grey matter density and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burdens were obtained from pre-mortem MRI and analyzed in relation to Alzheimer's, vascular, Lewy body, TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) pathologies. After exploring co-occurrence profiles of these pathologies, voxel-based morphometry was implemented to determine their joint and independent effects on grey matter loss. The impact of these pathologies on WMH burden was then evaluated both in spatial and quantitative combined analyses, using voxel-based and generalized linear models respectively. RESULTS: 86.8% of patients in this cohort presented more than one pathology. The combined structural effect of these pathologies was a focal impact on hippocampal grey matter atrophy, primarily driven by HS and Alzheimer's pathology (family-wise error corrected, p < 0.05), which also exhibited the strongest individual effects (uncorrected, p < 0.001). WMHs, predominant in middle and anterior cerebral portions, were most strongly associated with vascular (T = 2.47, p = 0.017) and tau pathologies (T = 2.09, p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The mixed associations of these dementia neuroimaging hallmarks are relevant for the fine-tuning of diagnostic protocols and underscore the need for comprehensive pathology evaluations in the study of dementia phenotypes.",Alzheimer's research & therapy
40046332,Enlarged cavum septum pellucidum as a neuroimaging signature of head impact exposure.,"Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is commonly observed upon neuroimaging examination in individuals exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and post-mortem in cases with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Consequently, CSP has been proposed as a potential biomarker for RHI-related neurodegeneration, yet prevalence estimates of CSP across other neurodegenerative diseases and its clinical implications are largely unknown. We assessed CSP prevalence and clinical correlates in individuals with RHI exposure, a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neurodegenerative disease (i.e. Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia) and normal cognition. The primary group of interest, i.e. individuals exposed to RHI in contact sports or military service (n = 65; mean exposure 21.58 years), was compared against age- and sex-matched participants with TBI (n = 57; number of TBI range: 1-5) and non-exposed participants of the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (Alzheimer's disease, n = 30; frontotemporal dementia, n = 24; normal cognition, n = 27). Structural 3D brain MRI scans were visually rated for CSP grade (ranging 0-4) by two raters blinded to the clinical information. A CSP of at least Grade 2 was considered enlarged/abnormal. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohens' weighted Kappa (κ). We investigated whether prevalence of enlarged CSP differed between groups and assessed associations with neuropsychological outcomes (verbal memory, processing speed, mental flexibility and semantic fluency), neuropsychiatric symptoms (neuropsychiatric inventory), ventricular enlargement as measured with Evan's index and MRI volumes of composite regions (limbic, temporal-meta regions and the whole brain). Inter-rater reliability was substantial [κ = 0.734 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.80)]. An enlarged CSP was more often observed in the RHI group (44.6%) compared with individuals with Alzheimer's disease [13.3%, odds ratio (OR) = 5.24 (1.79-19.26)], frontotemporal dementia [16.7%, OR = 4.03 (1.35-15.02)] and normal cognition [18.5%, OR = 3.54 (1.27-11.62)], all P (FDR) < 0.05, but not compared with the TBI group [29.8%, OR = 1.90 (0.90-4.06), P (FDR)  = 0.094]. In those with RHI, enlarged CSP was associated with lower outcomes on verbal memory learning (η² = 0.09, P (FDR) = 0.023) and recall (η² = 0.08, P (FDR) = 0.030). For TBI, enlarged CSP was associated with lower performance on verbal memory learning; however, this lost significance after multiple comparison correction (η² = 0.014, P (FDR) = 0.09). Enlarged CSP was not associated with the composite MRI volumes, ventricular enlargement or neuropsychiatric symptoms. In summary, enlarged CSP was more prevalent in RHI-exposed individuals compared with individuals with a neurodegenerative disease or normal cognition, but not compared with TBI, and was associated with lower verbal memory performance in the RHI group. Our study highlights enlarged CSP as a potential consequence of long-term head impact exposure and, to a lesser extent, TBI, rather than a general consequence of neurodegeneration.",Brain communications
40161217,"Unravelling pathological ageing with brain age gap estimation in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and schizophrenia.","Brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE), the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age, might be a putative biomarker aiming to detect the transition from healthy to pathological brain ageing. The biomarker primarily models healthy ageing with machine learning models trained with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. BrainAGE is expected to translate the deviations in neural ageing trajectory and has been shown to be increased in multiple pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Thus, accelerated ageing seems to be a general feature of neuropathological processes. However, neurobiological constraints remain to be identified to provide specificity to this biomarker. Explainability might be the key to uncovering age predictions and understanding which brain regions lead to an elevated predicted age on a given pathology compared to healthy controls. This is highly relevant to understanding the similarities and differences in neurodegeneration in AD and T2D, which remains an outstanding biological question. Sensitivity maps explain models by computing the importance of each voxel on the final prediction, thereby contributing to the interpretability of deep learning approaches. This paper assesses whether sensitivity maps yield different results across three conditions related to pathological neural ageing: AD, schizophrenia and T2D. Five deep learning models were considered, each model trained with different MRI data types: minimally processed T(1)-weighted brain scans, and corresponding grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid tissue segmentation and deformation fields (after spatial normalization). Our results revealed an increased BrainAGE in all pathologies, with a different mean, which is the smallest in schizophrenia; this is in line with the observation that neural loss is secondary in this early-onset condition. Importantly, our findings suggest that the sensitivity, indexing regional weights, for all models varies with age. A set of regions were shown to yield statistical differences across conditions. These sensitivity results suggest that mechanisms of neurodegeneration are quite distinct in AD and T2D. For further validation, the sensitivity and the morphometric maps were compared. The findings outlined a high congruence between the sensitivity and morphometry maps for age and clinical group conditions. Our evidence outlines that the biological explanation of model predictions is vital in adding specificity to the BrainAGE and understanding the pathophysiology of chronic conditions affecting the brain.",Brain communications
40534708,Recent Advances in Visual Dysfunction and Ocular Biomarkers in Neurological Disorders.,"The visual system is an integral part of the central nervous system, and visual symptoms often serve as an early manifestation of underlying neurological pathologies. This review synthesizes recent findings on visual dysfunction in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. These reports emphasize that ophthalmological symptoms are increasingly recognized as part of a broader spectrum of neurological conditions, enhancing their clinical relevance for differential diagnosis and symptom management. Non-invasive, high-resolution ocular imaging techniques can identify retinal pathologies at the subcellular level. Additionally, the non-invasive visual functional assay, electroretinography, can further corroborate findings of retinal pathology. Distinct retinal changes are detectable in the early stages of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline in conditions like Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Joubert syndrome. These findings highlight the clinical potential of retinal imaging for risk assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring the progression of diseases with insidious onset. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the retina's accessibility as a key component in investigating the underlying pathophysiology of neurological conditions. Additional clinical and basic science research is needed to better understand the distinct and potentially interconnected contributions of the brain and retina to specific visual symptoms. Investigating suitable preclinical mouse models will be vital for developing and refining novel ocular diagnostic markers, which are important for symptom management and the advancement of therapeutic strategies.",Eye and brain
39885672,Chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI for neurodegenerative diseases: An update on clinical and preclinical studies.,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging is an advanced imaging technique that enables the detection of compounds at low concentrations with high sensitivity and spatial resolution and has been extensively studied for diagnosing malignancy and stroke. In recent years, the emerging exploration of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging for detecting pathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases has opened up new possibilities for early detection and repetitive scans without ionizing radiation. This review serves as an overview of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging with detailed information on contrast mechanisms and processing methods and summarizes recent developments in both clinical and preclinical studies of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, focusing on peer-reviewed articles from the past 15 years relevant to clinical and preclinical applications. The findings suggest that chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to detect molecular changes and altered metabolism, which may aid in early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. Although promising results have been observed in selected clinical and preclinical trials, further validations are needed to evaluate their clinical value. When combined with other imaging modalities and advanced analytical methods, chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging shows potential as an in vivo biomarker, enhancing the understanding of neuropathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.",Neural regeneration research
39931431,RIPK1 expression and inhibition in tauopathies: implications for neuroinflammation and neuroprotection.,"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration/aggregation of TAU protein. One of the main challenges of these diseases is that they have neither biomarkers nor pharmacological targets to stop the neurodegenerative process. Apart from the neurodegenerative process, tauopathies are also characterized by a chronic low-grade neuroinflammation process, where the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) protein plays an essential role. Our research aimed to explore the role of RIPK1 in various tauopathies. We examined mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as brain tissue samples from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary form of 4R tauopathy, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered a secondary tauopathy. Our findings show elevated levels of RIPK1 mRNA levels across various forms of tauopathies, in both mouse models and human tissue samples associated with primary and secondary TAU-related disorders. Furthermore, we investigated the potential of using a RIPK1 inhibitor, known as GSK2982772, in a mouse model as a novel treatment strategy for FTD. The data showed that GSK2982772 treatment effectively reduced the reactive astrocyte response triggered by TAU(P301L) overexpression. However, this RIPK1 inhibitor failed to protect against the neurodegeneration caused by elevated TAU(P301L) levels in the hippocampal region. These results suggest that although inhibiting RIPK1 activity may help reduce TAU-related astrogliosis in the brain, the complexity of the inflammatory pathways involved could explain the absence of neuroprotective effects against TAU-induced neurodegeneration.",Frontiers in neuroscience
40130194,Voluntary locomotion induces an early and remote hemodynamic decrease in the large cerebral veins.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Behavior regulates dural and cerebral vessels, with spontaneous locomotion inducing dural vessel constriction and increasing stimulus-evoked cerebral hemodynamic responses. It is vital to investigate the function of different vascular network components, surrounding and within the brain, to better understand the role of the neurovascular unit in health and neurodegeneration. AIM: We characterized locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses across vascular compartments of the whisker barrel cortex: artery, vein, parenchyma, draining, and meningeal vein. APPROACH: Using 2D-OIS, hemodynamic responses during locomotion were recorded in 9- to 12-month-old awake mice: wild-type, Alzheimer's disease (AD), atherosclerosis, or mixed (atherosclerosis/AD) models. Within the somatosensory cortex, responses were taken from pial vessels inside the whisker barrel region [(WBR): ""whisker artery"" and ""whisker vein""], a large vein from the sagittal sinus adjacent to the WBR (draining vein), and meningeal vessels from the dura mater (which do not penetrate cortical tissue). RESULTS: We demonstrate that locomotion evokes an initial decrease in total hemoglobin (HbT) within the draining vein before the increase in HbT within WBR vessels. The locomotion event size influences the magnitude of the HbT increase in the pial vessels of the WBR but not of the early HbT decrease within the draining veins. Following locomotion onset, an early HbT decrease was also observed in the overlying meningeal vessels, which unlike within the cortex did not go on to exceed baseline HbT levels during the remainder of the locomotion response. We show that locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses are altered in disease in the draining vein and whisker artery, suggesting this could be an important neurodegeneration biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: This initial reduction in HbT within the draining and meningeal veins potentially serves as a ""space-saving"" mechanism, allowing for large increases in cortical HbT associated with locomotion. Given this mechanism is impacted by disease, it may provide an important target for vascular-based therapeutic interventions.",Neurophotonics
40291595,Exploration of Epigenetic Mechanisms and Biomarkers Among Patients with Very-Late-Onset Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with Very Late-Onset Schizophrenia-like Psychosis (VLOSLP) and to develop methylation-based biomarkers that differentiate VLOSLP from Schizophrenia (SCZ) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). METHODS: We analyzed methylation microarray datasets (n = 1218) from SCZ and AD patients obtained from the GEO database. We then collected blood samples from VLOSLP patients and age-matched healthy controls (n = 80) at the Wuxi Mental Health Center for methylation microarray profiling and bisulfite sequencing validation. Differential methylation analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified candidate loci. We prioritized key methylation sites through integrated analysis of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL), linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, and blood-brain methylation correlations. Machine learning algorithms generated diagnostic models, with classification performance evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. RESULTS: Analysis revealed distinct DNA methylation signatures in VLOSLP patients compared to controls. The GNB5 gene exhibited shared epigenetic modifications across SCZ, AD, and VLOSLP, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism. The diagnostic model discriminating AD from VLOSLP demonstrated high accuracy, achieving an AUC of 1.0 in the training set and 0.958 in the test set (95% CI: 0.875-1.000). The AD versus SCZ classification model showed similar robustness, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.955 in training and test sets, respectively (95% CI: 0.926-0.983). The SCZ versus VLOSLP model achieved perfect discrimination (AUC = 1.0) in both training and test sets, with substantial clinical utility. Additional analyses suggested distinct molecular subtypes within VLOSLP. CONCLUSION: Specific DNA methylation alterations in VLOSLP are identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers. These findings may contribute to the development of molecular diagnostic tools, though further validation in larger, independent cohorts is warranted.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment
39353548,Microglial TREM2 promotes phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons after status epilepticus.,"In the central nervous system, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is exclusively expressed by microglia and is critical for microglial proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis. Microglial TREM2 plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, little is known about how TREM2 affects microglial function within epileptogenesis. To investigate this, we utilized male TREM2 knockout (KO) mice within the intra-amygdala kainic acid seizure model. Electroencephalographic analysis, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing revealed that TREM2 deficiency significantly promoted seizure-induced pathology. We found that TREM2 KO increased both the severity of acute status epilepticus and the number of spontaneous recurrent seizures characteristic of chronic focal epilepsy. Phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons by microglia was also impaired by TREM2 KO and reduced phagocytic activity correlated with increased spontaneous seizures. Analysis of human tissue from patients who underwent surgical resection for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy also showed a negative correlation between expression of the microglial phagocytic marker CD68 and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic generalized seizure history. These results indicate that microglial TREM2 and phagocytic activity are important to epileptogenic pathology.","Brain, behavior, and immunity"
39974169,"CSF IL-6, GDF-15, GFAP and NfL levels in early Alzheimer disease: a pilot study.","BACKGROUND: Despite their potential usefulness as biomarkers, no study has investigated the interactions between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the core AD CSF biomarkers in the same cohort of AD patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the CSF levels of these analytes in patients with AD and assess their clinical relevance in this neurological condition. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We assessed the levels of NfL, GFAP, GDF-15, TDP-43 and IL-6 in the CSF samples of 52 early AD patients and evaluated their partial reciprocal correlations and those with Abeta42, p-Tau, t-Tau and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), always adding age, sex and educational level as covariates. RESULTS: MMSE score showed a positive correlation with the Aβ 1-42 concentrations (r = 0.485; p < 0.001), and a negative correlation with GDF-15 concentrations (r = -0.418; p = 0.002). IL-6 concentrations showed a positive correlation with NfL concentrations (r = 0.312; p = 0.026) and a negative correlation with TDP-43 concentrations (r = -0.322; p = 0.021). TDP-43 concentrations showed a positive correlation with GFAP (r = 0.33, p = 0.018). The mediation analysis suggests that the association between GDF-15 and MMSE is primarily mediated by Aβ 1-42. CSF GDF-15 concentrations were higher in AD patients with low Aβ 1-42 concentrations than those with high Aβ 1-42 concentrations (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that CSF IL-6 levels correlate positively with markers of neuronal damage. CSF TDP-43 levels significantly correlated with GFAP, suggesting a potential link with reactive gliosis and astrocyte activation. In addition, while CSF GDF-15 levels negatively correlate with MMSE scores, mediation analysis revealed that this association is primarily indirect and mediated through Aβ 1-42 levels.",Therapeutic advances in neurological disorders
39897852,"Interplay between oxidative stress, neuroinflammatory cytokines and melatonin in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from cerebrospinal fluid analysis.","BACKGROUND: Among neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease (AD) displays the highest prevalence and the projected increase in its incidence will require new advances in early diagnosis and treatment, particularly for distinguishing AD from other dementias. While beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau biomarkers are currently used to discriminate AD from other tauopathies and dementias, additional indicators could enhance patient stratification for specific dementia types. The present study was designed to find potential associations among the classic neurologic markers, Aβ, total and phospho-tau (T-tau and P-tau), with other biomarkers including melatonin and its oxidative-derived metabolite, Formyl-N-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine (AFMK) levels, assayed in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken previously for diagnostic purposes. Other factors previously associated with the aetiology of AD, including redox indicators or proinflammatory biomarkers, were also included. METHODS: The cross-sectional study included a cohort of 148 patients showing signs of dementia. A group of age-matched patients without neurological disorders were used as controls. CSF levels of Aβ, T-tau and P-tau were assayed, and patients were further classified according to threshold CSF levels of the three markers protein following the criteria of NIA-AA. RESULTS: Correlational and group analysis showed a positive association between oxidative stress and neuronal damage. TNF-α negatively correlated with CSF Aβ levels (amyloid plaques) while only RANTES/CCL5 correlated positively with T-tau and P-tau. Qualitative analysis of the proinflammatory cytokines assayed showed a higher detection level in Aβ-positive patients. Regarding melatonin in the CSF, indolamine levels did not correlate with its major oxidative-derived metabolite, i.e., AFMK. However, melatonin CSF levels were significantly reduced in AD patients but not in OT. On the contrary, AFMK showed the opposite pattern, with higher levels in samples from patients displaying high T-tau and P-tau levels. Neuroinflammation was associated with Aβ deposits (low concentration in CSF), while oxidative stress significantly correlated with high T-tau and P-tau levels. Finally, among all the parameters assayed in CSF samples from the cohort studied, P-tau, in combination with antioxidant capacity, offered the best ROC curve for the diagnostic capacity to discriminate between AD and OT, showing an 85 % specificity. CONCLUSION: While oxidative stress is instead associated with high T- and P-tau levels, higher neuroinflammatory cytokines correlate with low CSF Aβ levels. An intriguing lack of correlation between neuroinflammation and melatonin found in this study could be as a result of sample size and requires further studies with a larger sample size. Even though indolamine levels in CSF drop significantly in AD, they do not correlate with AFMK, suggesting a different kynurenine synthesis source. None of them appear to discriminate between AD and OT. Finally, among all the parameters assayed in this study, P-tau in combination with antioxidant capacity, offered the best ROC curve for the diagnostic ability capacity to discriminate between AD and OT, showing an 85 % specificity. This study holds the potential to significantly improve patient stratification and contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Heliyon
40034508,"Association of mid-life cardiovascular risk with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration, and white matter hyperintensities: Heart SCORE brain study.","BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors in mid-life are associated with cognitive decline and late-life dementia. However, the role of these risk factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of mid-life 10-year ASCVD risk with late-life amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration [AT(N)] measures and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). METHODS: Participants enrolled in the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study between 2003-2005 (mid-life) and underwent brain MRI and PET scans in 2018-2022 (age >65 years, late-life) to detect and quantify amyloid (A, PiB-PET) and tau (T, Flortaucipir (FTP) PET) deposition, cortical thickness (N) and WMHs. Mid-life ASCVD risk was categorized as; borderline (5%-7.4%), intermediate (7.5%-<15%), or high (≥15%). Association of mid-life ASCVD risk HR (95% CI) was assessed using logistic and linear regressions with A, T, or N and chi square beta coefficients for WMH in late life. RESULTS: Over a ∼16 years follow up, in 135 participants (mean age 73 years), mid-life ASCVD risk categories had a graded association with neurodegeneration (OR(ASCVD high vs low risk%) 6.98 [2.44-19.95]; p < 0.05) driven primarily by self-identified Black race and age, while none with A and T. ASCVD risk score was also associated with WMHs ((β=0.42 ± 0.22; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this asymptomatic, diverse cohort, 10-year ASCVD risk was predictive of late-life neurodegeneration and WMHs but not amyloid or tau. Further mechanistic studies can elucidate whether midlife ASCVD risk factors associated neurodegeneration initiates brain vulnerability leading to AD in late life.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports
39822062,Plasma proteomic biomarkers as mediators or moderators for the association between poor cardiovascular health and white matter microstructural integrity: The UK Biobank study.,"INTRODUCTION: The plasma proteome's mediating or moderating roles in the association between poor cardiovascular health (CVH) and brain white matter (WM) microstructural integrity are largely unknown. METHODS: Data from 3953 UK Biobank participants were used (40-70 years, 2006-2010), with a neuroimaging visit between 2014 and 2021. Poor CVH was determined using Life's Essential 8 (LE8) and reversing standardized z-scores (LE8(z) (_rev)). The plasma proteome was examined as a potential mediator or moderator of LE8(z) (_rev)'s effects on quantitative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) metrics. RESULTS: LE8(z_rev) was significantly associated with deteriorated WM microstructural integrity, as reflected by lower tract-averaged fractional anisotropy (dMRI-FA(mean)), (β ± standared error (SE): -0.00152 ± 0.0003, p < 0.001) and higher tract-averaged orientation dispersion (dMRI-OD(mean)), (β ± SE:+0.00081 ± 0.00017, p < 0.001). Ten strongly mediating plasma proteins of 1463 were identified, with leptin as the principal driver. DISCUSSION: Poor CVH is linked to poor WM microstructural integrity measures (lower FA(mean) and higher OD(mean)), mostly mediated through leptin. HIGHLIGHTS: Up to 3953 UK Biobank participants were selected for this study. Poor cardiovascular health (CVH) was determined using Life's Essential 8. The plasma proteome was examined as a potential mediator or moderator of poor CVH's effect on dMRI metrics.

39865686,"Gait, balance, and physical performance as markers of early Alzheimer's disease and related dementia risk.","BACKGROUND: Declining physical functionality is an indicator of cognitive impairment, distinguishing normal cognition (NC) from dementia. Whether this extends to pre-dementia stages is unclear. OBJECTIVE: Assess physical performance patterns, evaluate relationships with imaging biomarkers, and identify specific measures distinguishing NC, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Group differences (78 NC, 35 SCD, and 41 MCI) in physical function (global function, balance, gait speed, step length, single leg support) were evaluated with logistic regression while distinguishing between MCI due-to-AD and MCI due-to-vascular etiology. Relationships with imaging biomarkers (cortical atrophy score, white matter hyperintensities volumes) were analyzed with ANCOVA. RESULTS: Participants were 68.6 ± 9.3 years old, had 16.2 ± 3.0 years of education, and 23% were ethnoracial minorities. Physical performance distinguished MCI from NC and SCD. Greater performance on the Mini Physical Performance Test (mini PPT) and balance were associated with lower odds of being SCD versus NC (OR(mini PPT) = 0.73; 95% CI:0.56-0.97; OR(balance) = 0.35, 95%CI:0.16-0.80). AD etiology accounted for most group differences in physical performance versus vascular etiology. Consistent associations between biomarkers, physical performance, and cognition were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that: 1) changes in mini PPT performance and balance may help detect cognitive impairments, as early as the SCD stage; 2) changes in gait speed, gait cycle parameters, and Timed Up-and-Go may indicate more significant cognitive impairment; 3) neuronal loss is linked to subtle changes in physical functionality as early as SCD.

Anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) encephalitis is a rare but treatable type of AE discovered in recent years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia. AD may undergo a series of pathological physiological changes in brain tissue 20 years before the onset of typical symptoms. The stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that occurs during this process, known as MCI due to AD, is the earliest stage with clinical symptoms. MCI is typically categorized into two subtypes: Amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-aMCI. CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a patient with rapid cognitive impairment, diagnosed with anti-LGI1 antibody-mediated AE and aMCI, and treated at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital in March 2023. The patient was hospitalized with acute memory decline for more than 3 months. Both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum were positive for anti-LGI1 antibodies, biomarkers of AD coexisting in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Following combination treatment with immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoid, plus inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, the patient's cognitive function significantly improved. Throughout the 3-month follow-up period, a sustained improvement in cognitive function was observed. The results of serum anti-LGI1 antibody were negative. CONCLUSION: This case has raised awareness of the possible interaction between AE and early AD (including MCI due to AD), and alerted clinicians to the possibility of concurrent rare and common diseases in patients presenting with cognitive impairment.",World journal of radiology
40322539,Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer's disease mice.,"Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, Aβ and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD. A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability. The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm. Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity. These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate.",NPJ drug discovery
39840019,Olfactory dysfunction as potential biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases represent a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system, leading to a range of cognitive, motor, and sensory impairments. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the association between neurodegenerative diseases and olfactory dysfunction (OD). Characterized by a decline in the ability to detect or identify odors, OD has been observed in various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This phenomenon often precedes the onset of other clinical symptoms, suggesting its potential utility as an early marker or prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a vast literature overview on the current knowledge of OD in PD, AD, ALS, and HD in order to evaluate its potential as a biomarker, particularly in the early and prodromal stages of these diseases. We summarize the most common methods used to measure olfactory function and delve into neuropathological correlations and the alterations in neurotransmitter systems associated with OD in those neurodegenerative diseases, including differences in genetic variants if applicable, and cater to current pitfalls and shortcomings in the research.",Frontiers in neuroscience

40255880,Global Burden of Alzheimer's Disease Attributable to High Fasting Plasma Glucose: Epidemiological Trends and Machine Learning Insights.,"PURPOSE: High fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to analyze global trends in AD death rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates attributable to HFPG from 1990 to 2021 and assess the potential of glucose-related biomarkers in predicting cognitive impairment. METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database were used to analyze AD death rates and DALY rates due to HFPG across 204 countries. All rates were age-standardized. Joinpoint regression, age-period-cohort models, and ARIMA were employed to analyze trends and make future predictions. NHANES data were used to build machine learning models (including logistic regression, SVM, random forests, etc). to evaluate glucose-related biomarkers in predicting cognitive impairment. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, global AD death rates attributable to HFPG increased from 2.64 (95% UI: 0.11, 8.38) to 3.73 (95% UI: 0.15, 11.84), with the highest increases in high-income North America, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. DALY rates also rose globally, from 47.07 (95% UI: 2.72, 126.46) to 66.42 (95% UI: 3.83, 178.85). The greatest impact was observed in females, particularly those aged 80 and above. Joinpoint analysis indicated a significant rise in death rates from 1995 to 2000, followed by a slower increase in recent years. ARIMA model predictions indicate a gradual decline in death rates and DALY rates over the next 15 years. Logistic regression models showed the highest accuracy (90.4%) in predicting cognitive impairment, with 2-hour postprandial glucose and fasting plasma glucose being key predictors. CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2021, global AD death rates and DALY rates due to HFPG significantly increased, with a greater burden in females and regions with higher socio-demographic development. Machine learning models are effective tools for identifying individuals at high risk of elevated blood glucose leading to cognitive impairment.",Risk management and healthcare policy
40012679,TDP-43 as a potential retinal biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases.,"TDP-43 proteinopathies are a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) characterized by the pathological cytoplasmic aggregation of the TDP-43 protein. These include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and others. TDP-43 in the eye shows promise as a biomarker for these NDDs. Several studies have identified cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions in retinal layers of donors with ALS, FTLD, AD, CTE, and other conditions using immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that pathological aggregates of TDP-43 in the human retina are most prevalent in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and CTE, suggesting these diseases may provide the most reliable context for studying the potential of TDP-43 as a retinal biomarker. Animal model studies have been pivotal in exploring TDP-43's roles in the retina, including its nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, RNA binding properties, and interactions with other proteins. Despite these advances, more research is needed to develop therapeutic strategies. A major limitation of human autopsy studies is the lack of corresponding brain pathology assessments to confirm TDP-43 proteinopathy diagnosis and staging. Other limitations include small sample sizes, lack of antemortem eye pathology and clinical histories, and limited comparisons across multiple NDDs. Future directions for the TDP-43 as a retinal biomarker for NDDs include retinal tracers, hyperspectral imaging, oculomics, and machine learning development.",Frontiers in neuroscience

The Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health (BRANCH) captures a personalized learning curve for the same information presented over seven consecutive days. Here, we examined BRANCH multi-day learning curves (MDLCs) in 167 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age = 74.3 ± 7.5, 63% female) with different amyloid-β (A) and tau (T) biomarker profiles on positron emission tomography. MDLC scores decreased across ascending biomarker groups, with the A + T- group performing numerically worse (β = -0.24, 95%CI[-0.55,0.07], p = 0.128) and the A + T+ group performing significantly worse (β = -0.58, 95%CI[-1.06,-0.10], p = 0.018) than the A-T- group. Further, lower MDLC scores were associated with greater cortical thinning (β = 0.18, 95%CI[0.04,0.34], p = 0.013). Our results suggest that diminished MDLCs track with advanced AD pathophysiology, and demonstrate how a digital multi-day learning paradigm can provide novel insights about cognitive decline during preclinical AD.",NPJ digital medicine
40443531,"DNA methylation age from peripheral blood predicts progression to Alzheimer's disease, white matter disease burden, and cortical atrophy.","Cross-sectional studies suggest a limited relationship between accelerated epigenetic aging derived from epigenetic clocks, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology or risk. However, most prior analyses have not utilized longitudinal analyses or whole-brain neuroimaging biomarkers of AD. Herein, we employed longitudinal modeling and structural neuroimaging analyses to test the hypothesis that accelerated epigenetic aging would predict AD progression. Using survival analyses, we found that two second-generation epigenetic clocks, DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge, predicted progression from cognitively normal aging to mild cognitive impairment or AD and worse longitudinal cognitive outcomes. Epigenetic age was also strongly associated with cortical thinning in AD-relevant regions and white matter disease burden. Thus, in contrast to earlier work suggesting limited applicability of blood-based epigenetic clocks in AD, our novel analytic framework suggests that second-generation epigenetic clocks have broad utility and may represent promising predictors of AD risk and pathophysiology.",NPJ dementia
39997692,Age-Related Changes in Caudate Glucose Metabolism: Insights from Normative Modeling Study in Healthy Subjects.,"BACKGROUND: As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia, continues to rise. Understanding the impact of aging on striatal glucose metabolism is pivotal in identifying potential biomarkers for the early detection of these disorders. METHODS: We investigated age-related changes in striatal glucose metabolism using both region of interest (ROI)-based and voxel-wise correlation analyses. Additionally, we employed a normative modeling approach to establish age-related metabolic trajectories and assess individual deviations from these normative patterns. In vivo cerebral glucose metabolism was quantified using a molecular neuroimaging technique, (18)F-FDG PET. RESULTS: Our results revealed significant negative correlations between age and glucose metabolism in the bilateral caudate. Furthermore, the normative modeling demonstrated a clear, progressive decline in caudate metabolism with advancing age, and the most pronounced reductions were observed in older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that metabolic reductions in the caudate may serve as a sensitive biomarker for normal aging and offer valuable insights into the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, by establishing age-specific reference values for caudate glucose metabolism, the normative model provides a framework for detecting deviations from expected metabolic patterns, which may facilitate the early identification of metabolic alterations that could precede clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative processes.",Metabolites
39908264,Exploiting the Fractionation of Stable Isotopes in Biochemical Processes for Medical Diagnosis: A Narrative Review.,"Analysis of isotope distributions plays a crucial role in medical diagnostics. While radioactive and radiogenic isotopes - those that undergo or result from radioactive decay - are widely used, stable isotopes are less commonly applied despite their significant diagnostic potential. For example, calcium isotope ratio analysis is already commercially utilized for calcium loss and the early diagnosis of osteoporosis. Additionally, analyses of iron, copper, and zinc isotope ratios have been explored in various conditions, including hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Altered isotope ratios in these diseases are thought to reflect pathophysiologically relevant processes, making them promising biomarkers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current and potential applications of stable isotope analysis in medicine.",Aging and disease
39737803,Real-Time 2D Phase-Contrast MRI to Assess Cardiac- and Respiratory-Driven CSF Movement in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow is typically evaluated with a cardiac-gated two-dimensional (2D) phase-contrast (PC) MRI through the cerebral aqueduct. This approach is limited by the evaluation of a single location and does not account for respiration effects on flow. In this study, we quantified the cardiac and respiratory contributions to CSF movement at multiple intracranial locations using a real-time 2D PC-MRI and evaluated the diagnostic value of CSF dynamics biomarkers in classifying iNPH patients. METHODS: This study included 37 participants: 16 iNPH, 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 11 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. Anatomical and real-time (non-gated) PC images were acquired in a 3T Philips scanner. CSF flow was assessed at the foramen magnum, fourth ventricle, Sylvian fissure, lateral ventricle, and cerebral aqueduct. We calculated three CSF dynamics biomarkers: mean velocity amplitude, cardiac signal power, and respiratory signal power. Biomarkers from each location were evaluated for classifying iNPH versus AD and CU using support vector machine (SVM). A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The velocity amplitude and cardiac signal power were significantly reduced in iNPH compared to CU (p < 0.005) and AD (p < 0.05) at the lateral ventricle. The SVM model using biomarkers from the lateral ventricle performed significantly better at classifying iNPH than the other locations in terms of accuracy (p < 0.005) and diagnostic odds ratio (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CSF movement beyond the cerebral aqueduct may aid in identifying patients with and understanding the pathophysiology of iNPH.",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of
40330595,"Relationship between cerebrospinal fluid circulation markers, brain degeneration, and cognitive impairment in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation markers alter in patients with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (pCAA) and whether they are associated with brain degeneration and cognitive impairment. METHODS: We screened pCAA patients from the ADNI3 database according to the Boston 2.0 Criteria. Fifty-two patients with cognitive impairment (26 pCAA; 26 age-sex-matched non-pCAA) and 26 age-sex-matched cognitively normal control (NC) were included in this study. All participants underwent neurological MRI and cognitive assessments. Choroid plexus (ChP) was segmented using a deep learning-based method and its volume was extracted. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) was used to assess perivenous fluid mobility. AD pathological markers (Aβ and tau) were assessed using positron emission tomography. Brain parenchymal damage markers included white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume and brain atrophy ratio. All markers were compared among the three groups. Correlations among the ChP volume, DTI-ALPS index, parenchymal damage markers, and cognitive scales were analyzed in the pCAA group. RESULTS: The three groups exhibited significant differences in cognitive scores, AD biomarkers, and imaging markers. Post hoc analyses showed that patients with pCAA had significantly higher WMH volume, higher Aβ and tau deposition, and lower DTI-ALPS compared to NC. However, no difference in ChPs volume was found among the groups. Controlling for age, sex, and vascular risk factors, partial correlation analyses showed a significant negative correlation between the DTI-ALPS and WMH volume fraction (r = -0.606, p = 0.002). ChP volume was significantly associated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r = -0.492, p = 0.028).

39963290,Connectome-based prediction of future episodic memory performance for individual amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients.,"The amnestic mild cognitive impairment progression to probable Alzheimer's disease is a continuous phenomenon. Here we conduct a cohort study and apply machine learning to generate a model of predicting episodic memory development for individual amnestic mild cognitive impairment patient that incorporates whole-brain functional connectivity. Fifty amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients completed baseline and 3-year follow-up visits including episodic memory assessments (e.g. Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall) and resting-state functional MRI scanning. Using a multivariate analytical method known as relevance vector regression, we found that the baseline whole-brain functional connectivity features failed to predict the baseline Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall scores (r = 0.17, P = 0.082). Nonetheless, the baseline whole-brain functional connectivity pattern could predict the longitudinal Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall score with statistically significant accuracy (r = 0.50, P < 0.001). The connectivity that contributed most to the prediction (i.e. the top 1% connectivity) included within-default mode connections, within-limbic connections and the connections between default mode and limbic systems. More importantly, these connections with the highest absolute contribution weight mainly displayed long anatomical distances (i.e. Euclidean distance >75 mm). These 'neural fingerprints' may be appropriate biomarkers for amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients to optimize individual patient management and longitudinal evaluation in a timely fashion.",Brain communications

39814858,Revealing excitation-inhibition imbalance in Alzheimer's disease using multiscale neural model inversion of resting-state functional MRI.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder without a clear understanding of pathophysiology. Recent experimental data have suggested neuronal excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance as an essential element of AD pathology, but E-I imbalance has not been systematically mapped out for either local or large-scale neuronal circuits in AD, precluding precise targeting of E-I imbalance in AD treatment. METHOD: In this work, we apply a Multiscale Neural Model Inversion (MNMI) framework to the resting-state functional MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to identify brain regions with disrupted E-I balance in a large network during AD progression. RESULTS: We observe that both intra-regional and inter-regional E-I balance is progressively disrupted from cognitively normal individuals, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to AD. Also, we find that local inhibitory connections are more significantly impaired than excitatory ones and the strengths of most connections are reduced in MCI and AD, leading to gradual decoupling of neural populations. Moreover, we reveal a core AD network comprised mainly of limbic and cingulate regions. These brain regions exhibit consistent E-I alterations across MCI and AD, and thus may represent important AD biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Lastly, the E-I balance of multiple brain regions in the core AD network is found to be significantly correlated with the cognitive test score. CONCLUSIONS: Our study constitutes an important attempt to delineate E-I imbalance in large-scale neuronal circuits during AD progression, which may facilitate the development of new treatment paradigms to restore physiological E-I balance in AD.",Communications medicine
40224959,Higher dietary butyrate intake is associated with better cognitive function in older adults: evidence from a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Studies indicate that butyrate can enhance memory and cognitive functions in mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Elevated fecal butyrate levels in older individuals with mild cognitive impairment correlate with reduced levels of Aβ-42, an Alzheimer's disease biomarker. This study investigated the relationship between butyrate consumption and cognitive performance in older adults, which remains to be elucidated. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional, observational design to analyze data gathered from 2,078 participants enrolled in the 2011-2014 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Butyrate intake was determined based on two 24-h dietary assessments. To evaluate cognitive function, three tests were administered: the Animal Fluency Test (AFT) to assess executive function, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) for measuring processing speed, and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) subtest for assessing memory. Z scores were computed for each test and overall cognitive performance. Multivariate linear regression models and a generalized additive model (GAM) were used to examine the correlation between butyrate consumption and mental functions. Finally, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were used to verify the robustness of the associations. RESULTS: The NHANES study encompasses two surveys conducted between 2011 and 2014 that involved 2,078 participants aged 60 years or older. Higher dietary butyrate consumption had a positive correlation between superior performance on DSST, AFT, CERAD-Immediate Recall Test, and Z scores. The participants in the upper quartile of butyrate intake had significantly higher DSST (β = 1.60, 95% CI: 0.04-3.17), AFT scores (β = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.37-1.60), and Z scores (β = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.17) than individuals in the lowest quartile even after adjusting for potential confounders. Finally, no notable interactions were observed within the groupings. Finally, in subgroup analyses, BMI was found to influence the positive association between butyrate and DSST with Z score, and hypertension also influenced the association between butyrate and DSST. CONCLUSION: Higher butyrate intake in individuals aged ≥60 years was linked to better cognitive functioning. This could potentially contribute to maintaining brain function during aging.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39996035,Amyloid is associated with accelerated atrophy in cognitively unimpaired individuals.,"INTRODUCTION: This study examined the association of longitudinal atrophy with baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ, A) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau, T) biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181) in 406 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals (6.670 years of follow-up on average, up to 13 imaging visits) to assess whether A+ is associated with Alzheimer's disease-like atrophy and whether this depends on p-tau181 levels. METHODS: An A-T- CU group free from abnormal neurodegeneration (N) was identified using a robust normative approach and used to model normal age-related atrophy via z-scoring. Linear mixed-effects models tested differences in longitudinal atrophy between A+ and A-T-N- individuals and between A/T subgroups. RESULTS: A+ was associated with worse atrophy within and beyond the medial temporal lobe, even at low levels of p-tau181. DISCUSSION: Neurodegeneration likely begins soon after the onset of abnormal Aβ pathology. Clinical intervention at the earliest signs of Aβ pathology may be needed to mitigate further neurodegeneration. HIGHLIGHTS: An A-T-N- control group was identified using a robust normative approachA+ was associated with accelerated atrophy in cognitively unimpaired individualsAtrophy was observed even at low p-tau181 levels.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39845447,Decreased prefrontal activation during verbal fluency task after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for depression in Alzheimer's disease: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the clinical effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The measurement of brain activation links neurobiological and functional aspects but is challenging in patients with dementia. This study investigated the influence of rTMS on cortical activation in patients with AD and depressive symptoms, measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, patients with AD and depression received either active rTMS (n = 17) or sham-rTMS (n = 16). Patients received 4 weeks of bilateral standard rTMS (1 Hz rTMS delivered to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and 10-Hz rTMS delivered to the left DLPFC). RESULTS: No significant changes were found in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI); however, significant changes were found for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the depression score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-depression; p < 0.05). The results showed a decrease in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, as measured with fNIRS, from baseline to week 4 in CH41 (in right DLPFC; p = 0.0047, FDR-corrected). There was a negative correlation between the improvement in HAMD-17 severity in these patients and reduced oxygenated hemodynamic response of CH41 (r = - 0.504, p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: The results indicated a positive effect of rTMS on depression in patients with AD. The underlying cortical changes were imaged using fNIRS. Prefrontal activation measured by fNIRS is a potential biomarker for monitoring the response of patients with depression in AD to rTMS treatment.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40007799,Blood biomarkers to identify patients with different intracranial lesion combinations after traumatic brain injury.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of studies examining the most promising blood biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in relation to gross pathology types. RESEARCH QUESTION: To examine whether the admission levels of blood biomarkers can discriminate patients with different combinations of traumatic intracranial findings from patients with negative computed tomography (CT) scans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred thirty patients with all severities of TBI were studied. Seventy-five had CT-positive and 55 CT-negative findings. CT-positive patients were divided into three clusters (CL) using the Helsinki CT score: focal lesions (CL1), mixed lesions (CL2) and mixed lesions + intraventricular haemorrhage (CL3). CT scans were obtained upon admission and blood samples taken within 24 h from admission. S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), heart fatty-acid binding protein (H-FABP), neurofilament light (NF-L), interleukin-10 (IL-10), total-tau (t-tau), and β-amyloids 1-40 (Aβ40) and 1-42 (Aβ42) were analysed from plasma samples. CT-negative cluster was used as control. RESULTS: GFAP, Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels differed between the clusters, but not significantly. NF-L and t-tau discriminated CL1 from CT-negative cluster with AUCs of 0.737 and 0.771, respectively. NF-L, t-tau and GFAP discriminated CL2 from CT-negative cluster with AUCs of 0.839, 0.781 and 0.840, respectively. All biomarkers analysed were able to discriminate CL3 and CT-negative cluster. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: All studied biomarkers distinguished the most severely injured cluster, CL3, from CT-negative cluster. The results may reflect the severity of TBI but also show that biomarkers have a variable ability to identify patients with combinations of intracranial traumatic lesions in the examined time window.",Brain & spine
39838927,Mitochondria-Related Genome-Wide Mendelian Randomization Identifies Putatively Causal Genes for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondria-related genes. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets for these diseases through a comprehensive analysis that integrated genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) with genes associated with mitochondrial function. METHODS: Using existing publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and comprehensive data on 1136 mitochondria-related genes, we initially identified a subset of genes related to mitochondrial function that exhibited significant associations with NDDs. We then conducted colocalization and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to validate the causal role of these candidate genes. Additionally, we assessed the druggability of the encoded proteins to prioritize potential therapeutic targets for further exploration. RESULTS: Genetically predicted levels of 10 genes were found to be significantly associated with the risk of NDDs. Elevated DMPK and LACTB2 levels were associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk. Higher expression of NDUFAF2, BCKDK, and MALSU1, along with lower TTC19, raised Parkinson's disease risk. Higher ACLY levels were associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, while decreased MCL1, TOP3A, and VWA8 levels raised MS risk. These genes primarily impact mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Notably, several druggable protein targets identified are being explored for potential NDDs treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This data-driven MR study demonstrated the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in NDDs. Additionally, this study identified candidate genes that could serve as potential pharmacological targets for the prevention and treatment of NDDs. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society
40034740,Ketogenic diet and microRNAs: focus on cognitive function.,"Cognition is a mental process of understanding and learning driven by memory. Recent advances in molecular biology and neuroscience have revealed a fascinating interplay between cognitive function and microRNAs (miRNAs). The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and adequate-protein diet that triggers the synthesis of ketone bodies, establishing ketosis. Recent and accumulating studies on human and animal models have shown that the KD benefits neurodegenerative diseases, where cognition is affected. The KD can also modulate miRNAs, molecules that are dysregulated in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, where cognition is lost. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the function of miRNAs in neurodevelopment and cognition. We also explore how the KD in human studies can enhance cognitive function and highlight the protective role of microRNAs in neurological conditions.",Frontiers in nutrition
39888600,The effect of Lewy body (co-)pathology on the clinical and imaging phenotype of amnestic patients.,"Lewy body (LB) pathology is present as a co-pathology in approximately 50% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients and may even represent the main neuropathologic substrate in a subset of patients with amnestic impairments. However, the degree to which LB pathology affects the neurodegenerative course and clinical phenotype in amnestic patients is not well understood. Recently developed α-synuclein seed amplification assays (αSyn-SAAs) provide a unique opportunity for further investigating the complex interplay between AD and LB pathology in shaping heterogeneous regional neurodegeneration patterns and clinical trajectories among amnestic patients. We studied 865 patients from the ADNI cohort with clinical diagnoses of aMCI (N=661) or AD dementia (N=211), who had CSF and FDG-PET data available. CSF samples were analyzed for peptide levels of Aβ1-42 and p-tau181, and αSyn positivity was evaluated using a novel αSyn-SAA. Based on positive/negative results on the different biomarkers, subjects were classified as ""AD-LB-"" (N=304), ""AD+LB-"" (N=335), ""AD+LB+"" (N=158) and ""AD-LB+"" (N=68). We analyzed group differences in regional FDG-PET patterns, demographics, APOE4 genotype, baseline and longitudinal domain-specific cognitive profiles (memory vs executive function/visuospatial performance), as well as risk for developing hallucinations. AD+LB+ showed worse global cognition (MMSE: p=0.005) and declined faster (p<0.001) than AD+LB-, but both groups exhibited similar memory-predominant cognitive profiles. In FDG-PET, AD+LB+ showed more severe hypometabolism compared to AD+LB-, but both groups were characterized by largely identical patterns of temporo-parietal hypometabolism. By contrast, AD-LB+ were less globally impaired (p<0.001) but characterized by a markedly more dysexecutive and visuospatial profile (p<0.003) and a strikingly different posterior-occipital pattern of hypometabolism. APOE4 positivity was similar between AD+LB+ and AD+LB- (72% vs. 75%, p=0.28) but lower in AD-LB+ (28%, p<0.001). On a group level, AD+LB+, AD+LB-, and AD-LB+ showed similar risks of developing hallucinations, but patients with a LB-like posterior-occipital hypometabolism pattern had a significantly higher risk compared to those showing an AD-typical temporo-parietal pattern (HR=2.58, p=0.004). In conclusion, LB co-pathology in AD was associated with more severe hypometabolism and faster cognitive decline, but did not affect the regional hypometabolic pattern or cognitive profile. By contrast, patients with relatively pure LB pathology showed a more executive/visuospatial-predominant cognitive profile and a distinct posterior-occipital hypometabolism pattern characteristic for LB disease. These findings indicate that the presence of LB pathology may have different consequences for the clinical phenotype depending on AD co-morbidity, which may have critical implications for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with amnestic syndromes.",Brain : a journal of neurology
39834619,An EEG-based framework for automated discrimination of conversion to Alzheimer's disease in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment: an 18-month longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: As a clinical precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) bears a considerably heightened risk of transitioning to AD compared to cognitively normal elders. Early prediction of whether aMCI will progress to AD is of paramount importance, as it can provide pivotal guidance for subsequent clinical interventions in an early and effective manner. METHODS: A total of 107 aMCI cases were enrolled and their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected at the time of the initial diagnosis. During 18-month follow-up period, 42 individuals progressed to AD (PMCI), while 65 remained in the aMCI stage (SMCI). Spectral, nonlinear, and functional connectivity features were extracted from the EEG data, subjected to feature selection and dimensionality reduction, and then fed into various machine learning classifiers for discrimination. The performance of each model was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score. RESULTS: Compared to SMCI patients, PMCI patients exhibit a trend of ""high to low"" frequency shift, decreased complexity, and a disconnection phenomenon in EEG signals. An epoch-based classification procedure, utilizing the extracted EEG features and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, achieved the ACC of 99.96%, AUC of 99.97%, SEN of 99.98%, SPE of 99.95%, PPV of 99.93%, and F1-score of 99.96%. Meanwhile, the subject-based classification procedure also demonstrated commendable performance, achieving an ACC of 78.37%, an AUC of 83.89%, SEN of 77.68%, SPE of 76.24%, PPV of 82.55%, and F1-score of 78.47%. CONCLUSION: Aiming to explore the EEG biomarkers with predictive value for AD in the early stages of aMCI, the proposed discriminant framework provided robust longitudinal evidence for the trajectory of the aMCI cases, aiding in the achievement of early diagnosis and proactive intervention.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39967600,"Long non-coding RNAs in humans: Classification, genomic organization and function.","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate numerous biological functions in animals. Despite recent advances in lncRNA research, their structural and functional annotation and classification remain an ongoing challenge. This review provides a comprehensive overview of human lncRNAs, highlighting their genomic organization, mode of action and role in physiological and pathological processes. Subgroups of lncRNA genes are discussed using representative examples and visualizations of genomic organization. The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) categorizes lncRNAs into nine subgroups: (1) microRNA non-coding host genes, (2) small nucleolar RNA non-coding host genes, (3) long intergenic non-protein coding RNAs (LINC), (4) antisense RNAs, (5) overlapping transcripts, (6) intronic transcripts, (7) divergent transcripts, (8) long non-coding RNAs with non-systematic symbols and (9) long non-coding RNAs with FAM root systems. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a separate class that shares some characteristics with lncRNAs and are divided into exonic, intronic and intronic-exonic types. LncRNAs act as molecular signals, decoys, scaffolds and sponges for microRNAs and often function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). LncRNAs are involved in various physiological and pathological processes, such as cell differentiation, p53-mediated DNA damage response, glucose metabolism, inflammation and immune functions. They are associated with several diseases, including various types of neoplasms, Alzheimer's disease and autoimmune diseases. A clear classification system for lncRNA is essential for understanding their biological role and for facilitating practical applications in biomedical research. Future studies should focus on drug development and biomarker discovery. As important regulators of various biological processes, lncRNAs represent promising targets for innovative therapies.",Non-coding RNA research
39988983,Longitudinal patterns of brain aging and neurodegeneration among older adults with dual decline in memory and gait.,"INTRODUCTION: Dual cognitive and mobility decline is more strongly associated with dementia risk than cognitive decline only. It remains unknown whether this syndrome is associated with brain atrophy patterns, white matter (WM) damage, or pathology. METHODS: In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants with and without dual decline, we used linear mixed-effects models to compare up to 13-year longitudinal changes in MRI-derived atrophy patterns, WM hyperintensities (n = 339), microstructure (n = 307), plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid beta 42/40 (Aβ(42/40)) ratio (n = 349), and phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181) (n = 258). RESULTS: Those experiencing dual decline showed accelerated atrophy in medial temporal (p = .004), parietotemporal (p = .029), and perisylvian regions (p = .028), whereas gait decline only showed accelerated parietotemporal atrophy (p = .035) and memory decline only showed perisylvian atrophy (p = .021). Dual decline was also associated with unique microstructural deterioration in several WM tracts (p < .05), a greater decrease in Aβ(42/40) ratio (p = .015), and greater increases in GFAP (p = .009) and NfL (p < .001). DISCUSSION: Individuals experiencing dual decline are at an increased risk for regional brain atrophy, microstructural degradation, and biomarker-defined molecular changes underlying dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Those experiencing dual decline showed several accelerated brain atrophy patterns. Those experiencing dual decline showed unique microstructural deterioration. Dual decline showed a greater decline in plasma Aβ(42/40) ratio. Dual decline showed greater increases in plasma GFAP and NfL. Dual decline may indicate brain and blood markers underlying dementia.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39759950,The problem of multiple adjustments in the assessment of minimal clinically important differences.,"INTRODUCTION: Anthropometric, demographic, genetic, and clinical features may affect cognitive, behavioral, and functional decline, while clinical trials seldom consider minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) in their analyses. METHODS: MCIDs were reviewed taking into account features that may affect cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline in clinical trials of new disease-modifying therapies. RESULTS: The higher the number of comparisons of different confounders in statistical analyses, the lower P values will be significant. Proper selection of confounders is crucial to accurately assess MCIDs without compromising statistical significance. DISCUSSION: Statistical adjustment of the significance of MCIDs according to multiple comparisons is essential for the generalizability of research results. Wider inclusion of confounding variables in the statistics may help bring trial results closer to real-world conditions and improve the prediction of the efficacy of new disease-modifying therapies, though such factors must be carefully selected not to compromise the statistical significance of the analyses. HIGHLIGHTS: Anthropometric, demographic, and clinical features may affect cognitive, behavioral, and functional decline.Clinical trials seldom take minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) or their confounders into account.Generalizability of research results requires the assessment of multiple confounding factors.The higher the number of comparisons involved, the lower P values will be considered significant.Use of MCIDs adjusted for confounding factors should be implemented when outcomes are not susceptible to translation into absolute benefits.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40330593,Early identification of mild cognitive impairment: an innovative model using ocular biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive, irreversible brain damage. Current diagnostic procedures for AD are both costly and highly invasive for patients. Age-related cataract (ARC), a common ocular condition in elderly populations, correlates with a 1.43-fold increased risk of developing AD. This study sought to establish a novel model for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with ARC. METHODS: The study prospectively collected 170 monocular data as training dataset and 65 monocular data from another independent medical center as test dataset. Demographic data and comprehensive ophthalmic examination results were collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed using R software for dimensionality reduction and variable selection. A nomogram was constructed, and its discriminative ability was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI), as well as sensitivity and specificity. Internal validation was performed using 1,000-resample bootstrap analysis, while model calibration was assessed through calibration curves and Brier scores. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate clinical utility. A baseline model incorporating demographic variables was developed for comparison with the nomogram. Additionally, an external dataset from an independent medical center was employed as a test set to further validate the nomogram's predictive performance. An online calculator was created using the ""DynNom"" and ""rsconnect"" functions. RESULTS: Through LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses, six variables were identified and incorporated into the nomogram: age (OR: 1.097; 95%CI: 1.041-1.161; p < 0.001), years of education (OR: 0.333; 95%CI: 0.140-0.749; p = 0.010), diastolic blood pressure (OR: 0.949; 95%CI: 0.907-0.990; p = 0.019), short posterior ciliary artery flow rate (OR: 1.063; 95%CI: 1.008-1.132; p = 0.038), vertical cup-to-disc ratio (OR: 11.927; 95%CI: 1.059-155.308; p = 0.049), and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (inferior; OR: 0.979; 95%CI: 0.964-0.993; p = 0.005). The nomogram demonstrated strong discriminatory power for the diagnosis of MCI, with the area under the ROC curve reaching 0.791 (95%CI: 0.722-0.864) in the training dataset and 0.750 (95%CI: 0.627-0.858) in the external dataset. Calibration curve validation showed good agreement between predicted and ideal probabilities (p > 0.05, Brier score = 0.171). DCA indicated substantial net benefit across most threshold probabilities in both training and test datasets, supporting the nomogram's clinical utility. CONCLUSION: Through systematic analysis of clinical data, this study established and validated a novel online calculator for identifying early cognitive impairment in patients with ARC, using demographic and ocular biomarkers, thereby providing a visual representation of the prediction model.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39892529,UK Biobank MRI data can power the development of generalizable brain clocks: A study of standard ML/DL methodologies and performance analysis on external databases.,"In this study, we present a comprehensive pipeline to train and compare a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep learning brain clocks, integrating diverse preprocessing strategies and correction terms. Our analysis also includes established methodologies which have shown success in prior UK Biobank-related studies. For our analysis we used T1-weighted MRI scans and processed de novo all images via FastSurfer, transforming them into a conformed space for deep learning and extracting image-derived phenotypes for our machine learning approaches. We rigorously evaluated these approaches both as robust age predictors for healthy individuals and as potential biomarkers for various neurodegenerative conditions, leveraging data from the UK Biobank, ADNI, and NACC datasets. To this end we designed a statistical framework to assess age prediction performance, the robustness of the prediction across cohort variability (database, machine type and ethnicity) and its potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions. Results demonstrate that highly accurate brain age models, typically utilising penalised linear machine learning models adjusted with Zhang's methodology, with mean absolute errors under 1 year in external validation, can be achieved while maintaining consistent prediction performance across different age brackets and subgroups (e.g., ethnicity and MRI machine/manufacturer). Additionally, these models show strong potential as biomarkers for neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, where brain age prediction achieved an AUROC of up to 0.90 in distinguishing healthy individuals from those with dementia.",NeuroImage
39906488,Impact of hemolysis on the levels of proteins associated with aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicentric clinical research.,"INTRODUCTION: Hemolysis is a known interference factor that has been found to show erroneous effect. Present study analyzes the impact of hemolysis on the concentrations of protein biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (Aβ42, t-Tau, p-Tau181) along with novel proteins which are currently under investigation (SIRT1,SIRT2,SIRT6,FOXO3A, NFL, Aβ40, GFAP). METHODS: Plasma samples were grouped into two categories: hemolyzed and non-hemolyzed groups. Degree of hemolysis (in percentage) was separately analyzed using Single molecule array (SIMOA) technology. Quantitative analysis for hemolyzed and non-hemolyzed samples were done using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. RESULTS: The SIMOA analysis indicated that at high levels of hemolysis (1000 mg/dL) there was an increase in NFL protein level up to approximately 30 % whereas p-Tau181 did not show much interference even at higher hemolysate concentration. Aβ40, Aβ42 and GFAP showed modest effect up to hemolysis of 250mg/dL-500 mg/dL. SPR analysis of total Tau (t-Tau), p-Tau181, SIRT1, SIRT6 showed the consistency in the result and there was no significant difference in hemolyzed plasma compared to non-hemolyzed samples. Aβ42 and FOXO3A showed decline in hemolyzed plasma compared to non-hemolyzed samples (4.34 ± 0.18ng/ul; 4.95 ± 0.19ng/ul) and (3.83 ± 0.34ng/ul; 5.12 ± 0.46ng/ul), respectively whereas, a significant increase in the concentration was observed for SIRT2; 2.4 ± 0.10ng/ul in hemolyzed compared to 1.30 ± 0.22ng/ul in non-hemolyzed group. CONCLUSIONS: High grade hemolysis leads to altered protein concentration associated with neurodegeneration. Present study emphasizes the need to have pre-analytical inspection for hemolysis detection especially in a multicentric biomarker study.",Practical laboratory medicine
40489451,From eyes' microtremors to critical flicker fusion.,"The critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) is the frequency at which a flickering light source becomes indistinguishable from continuous light. The CFFT is an important biomarker of health conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy, and is affected by factors as diverse as fatigue, drug consumption, and oxygen pressure, which make CFFT individual- and context-specific. Other causal factors beyond such biophysical processes are still to be uncovered. We investigate the connection between CFFT and specific eye-movements, called microtremors, which are small oscillatory gaze movements during fixation periods. We present evidence that individual differences in CFFT can be accounted by microtremors, and design an experiment, using a high-frequency monitor and recording the participant's eye-movements with an eye-tracker device, which enables to measure the range of frequencies of a specific individual's CFFT. Additionally, we introduce a classifier that can predict if the CFFT of specific participant lies in the range of high or low frequencies, based on the corresponding range of frequencies of eyes' microtremors. Our results show an accuracy of [Formula: see text] for a frequency threshold of 60 Hz and [Formula: see text] for a threshold of 120 Hz.",PloS one
39974029,Evaluation of plasma p-tau217 for detecting amyloid pathology in a diverse and heterogeneous community-based cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest excellent performance of plasma p-tau217 for detecting amyloid pathology, though studies in more diverse populations are needed to validate previously determined cutpoints. METHODS: Plasma p-tau217 utility for detecting amyloid pathology (Aβ) via amyloid PET (n=598) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n=154) was assessed in a heterogeneous, community-based cohort in the Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WFADRC). Participants (n=598) were 21% Black; 313 cognitive unimpaired (CU), 214 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 64 dementia (DEM); 49% prediabetic, 44% hypertensive; 29% overweight/obese; and 64% with mild-to-moderate kidney disease. Gaussian-mixture models, logistic regression, and receiver operating curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 was associated with elevated Aβ deposition and accurately classified Aβ-positive participants (PET: AUC: 94%-97%, cutpoint≥.338 pg/mL; CSF: AUC = .84, cutpoint≥.307 pg/mL). DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 is an accurate indicator of amyloid pathology in a heterogeneous cohort, and superior to other plasma biomarkers assessed.

39877089,Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Proteomic Signature in Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD): Role of Adhesion Molecules.,"BACKGROUND: Although Amyloid-beta and Tau are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), other protein pathways such as endothelial dysfunction may be involved and may precede cognitive symptoms. Our objective was to characterize the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles focusing on cardiometabolic-related protein pathways in individuals on the AD spectrum. METHODS: We performed CSF and plasma-targeted proteomics (276 proteins) from 354 participants of the Brain Stress Hypertension and Aging Program (BSHARP), of which 8% had preclinical AD, and 24% had MCI due to AD. We instituted a bioinformatic pipeline to generate data-driven protein modules, used ""Hub"" and ""Critical"" proteins within each module to describe protein signatures for each AD stage and then assessed their associations with clinical and biological AD traits. Finally, we completed pathway enrichment analysis to get insight into pathways that might be implicated in AD pathogenesis. RESULTS: The 276 measured proteins clustered into five modules that were associated with CSF Amyloid-β42, Tau, and pTau. (all p-value <0.05). A CSF protein AD signature was characterized by elevated levels of CSF Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Intercellular and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), Neuropilin 1 and 2 (NRP-1, NRP-2), Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 2(SCARB2), Plasminogen Activator, Urokinase (PLAU). (all <0.05) We also found a significant difference in the CSF/Plasma ratio for the proteins associated with Cognitive Status and the Tau/Aβ42 ratio (TAR) in the CSF. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that cell adhesion and endothelial dysfunction (all p-value <0.05) were key mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, especially in the preclinical stage. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a proteomic signature in the CSF of individuals with preclinical AD that is driven by adhesion molecules and might be implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Future studies investigating these pathways may provide insights into novel AD biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Research square
40496973,"Protocol of a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of an 18-month, home-based, high-intensity, exercise intervention in older, cognitively unimpaired APOE ε4 carriers.","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization highlighted the potential protective role of exercise against cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia in healthy individuals. We have previously shown that exercise is particularly beneficial for older, cognitively unimpaired apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) carriers. A key unanswered question is whether a long-term, high-intensity aerobic exercise intervention initiated in a cohort of previously inactive older individuals at genetic risk for AD has neuroprotective properties. DESIGN: CYCLE-AD is a randomized, single-blind, single-center, controlled trial of a home-based, high-intensity exercise intervention involving 150 older ε4 carriers (ages 65-80 years) who are healthy, cognitively unimpaired, and physically inactive. Participants are randomized into two groups: indoor cycling (IC) or usual and customary care (UCC) (target of 75 each). IC participants exercise 3×/week on an upright stationary cycle ergometer at a moderate-vigorous intensity for 18 months. Those in the UCC group are expected to maintain enrollment levels of activity. OUTCOMES: Comparison of IC and UCC groups on change in primary and secondary outcomes over baseline, 9-month, and 18-month evaluations. Primary outcomes are VO(2peak) (Fitness), 5-trial total recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal List Learning Test (Episodic Memory), and total hippocampal volume derived from structural MRI (Brain Atrophy). Secondary outcomes include comprehensive neurocognitive and physical function test batteries, MRI scans including structural and functional connectivity measures, and blood-based biomarkers. HYPOTHESES: Over an 18-month interval, physically inactive ε4 carriers who engage in high-intensity aerobic exercise will demonstrate less cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy than physically inactive ε4 carriers who did not participate in a formal exercise program. CONCLUSION: Successful demonstration of a scalable, home-based, high-intensity aerobic exercise intervention in altering the trajectory of AD pathophysiology and its effects on cognitive functioning will transform AD treatment, improve patient outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39844123,The proof is in the pudding: patient engagement in studying cannabidiol in mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Patient engagement (PE) in clinical trials has gained importance yet remains uncommon, particularly in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a critical precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD) shows potential in slowing MCI progression due to its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. In CBD research, PE is underutilized too. To design a study on CBD for MCI, we administered an online survey to individuals with MCI to better understand their preferences for trial setup and outcomes. METHODS: We asked 209 individuals with MCI to complete an online survey assessing (i) willingness to participate in a trial using CBD; (ii) importance of improvements in various domains; (iii) acceptance of adverse events (AEs); (iv) reasons for AE-related dropout; (v) willingness to undergo blood sampling and lumbar puncture to assess AD pathology; and (vi) willingness to participate in a trial with a 50% chance of receiving a placebo. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: N = 118 agreed to participate and N = 88 completed the survey. Participants prioritized improvement in cognitive abilities (87.5%), followed by quality of life (63.6%), daily activities (55.7%), sleep (55.7%), pain (52.3%), mood (52.3%), behavior (48.9%), and anxiety (43.2%). Headache (55.7%) was the least accepted AE followed by nausea (46.6%), fatigue (35.2%), and diarrhea (35.2%). Persistent diarrhea (90.9%) and severe fatigue (84.1%) were the main reasons for potential dropout. While most would undergo blood sampling (67.0%), only a minority (21.6%) would accept lumbar puncture. One-third were ready to participate (34.1%), while 54.5% were interested pending details. Among those in favor of participation, 71.6% would participate even with a 50% chance of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified cognitive improvement as highly relevant for patients, indicating cognitive assessment tools as primary endpoints in MCI research. Given concerns about AEs, dose titration should be carefully considered to enhance acceptance and prevent AEs. Blood sampling seems well-accepted for AD biomarker assessment. Despite potential AEs, participation in a trial using CBD for MCI is seen as attractive, even under placebo-controlled conditions. This cross-sectional study emphasizes the importance of patient engagement in designing high-quality trials for using CBD to treat MCI.",BMC complementary medicine and therapies
40510267,Analysis of neuronal cardiolipin and monolysocardiolipin from biological samples with cyclic ion mobility mass spectrometry.,"The mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is essential for proper mitochondrial function and energy production. Cardiolipin has four distinct fatty acid tails with varying expression compositions, resulting in a highly variable tissue-specific distribution of isomer expression. Neuronal cardiolipin has a remarkable variety of subspecies and has recently been used as a biomarker to predict brain injury severity following cardiac arrest and traumatic brain injury. Multiple conditions have been associated with disordered cardiolipin remodeling, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Barth syndrome, and astrocytoma. The clinical relevance of cardiolipin as a biomarker and the importance of the mechanistic role of cardiolipin remodeling in disease emphasize the demand for a reliable and accurate means of the identification and quantification of cardiolipin. In this study, we outline the use of a novel method of cardiolipin analysis using cyclic ion mobility mass spectrometry (cIMS-MS) to isolate and identify cardiolipin subspecies in several biological samples. Furthermore, cIMS-MS established the composition of the cardiolipin profile by individual subspecies across biological samples under basal conditions. Monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), the precursor of mature cardiolipin and a primary diagnostic biomarker of Barth syndrome, was isolated from cardiolipin and identified. The monolysocardiolipin:cardiolipin ratio was quantified in brain samples from tafazzin-knockout (KO) mice, demonstrating accumulation of MLCL and providing direct evidence for the validity of this cIMS-MS methodology through genetic loss-of-function. The novel, multiple-pass feature of cIMS-MS enabled the isolation and amplification of less abundant cardiolipin subspecies in both standards and biological samples. This protocol enables rapid analysis of biological samples, allowing researchers to further dissect the mechanistic role of cardiolipin in injury pathology, with simplified sample preparation and reduced potential for artifact introduction.",Frontiers in physiology
39973938,"Systematic review of bidirectional interaction between gut microbiome, miRNAs, and human pathologies.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and the gut microbiome are key regulators of human health, with emerging evidence highlighting their complex, bidirectional interactions in chronic diseases. miRNAs, influence gene expression and can modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiome, impacting metabolic and immune processes.

39714176,"Prognostic serum biomarkers of synaptic, neuronal and glial injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke of the anterior circulation.","BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the prognostic role of β-synuclein in comparison to that of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for predicting functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: We measured serum concentrations of β-synuclein, NfL and GFAP 24 h after hospital admission in 213 consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe AIS. We investigated the association between serum biomarkers and radiological/clinical characteristics, 3-months mortality and functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: In 213 patients with AIS [mean age: 76.1 (±12.5) years, 53.1% males, median NIHSS score on admission: 13 (IQR: 9-17)], higher levels of β-synuclein, NfL and GFAP were associated with higher NIHSS scores and with lower Alberta Stroke Program CT Score (ASPECTS) points on admission. Serum β-synuclein levels was significantly correlated with NfL (rho = 0.715, p < 0.001) and GFAP concentrations (rho = 0.684, p < 0.001). The inclusion of serum β-synuclein significantly improved the accuracy of prediction models without biomarkers for overall mortality (AUC: 0.836 vs. 0.752, p < 0.001) and mRS 3-6 vs. 0-2 (AUC: 0.812 vs. 0.624, p < 0.001). Combination models with NfL and/or GFAP showed a similar accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Serum β-synuclein may be used to assess synaptic damage/dysfunction and to predict 3-months clinical outcomes in patients with AIS.",European journal of neurology
40034509,Effects of caregiving burden on serum homocysteine and folate levels in spouses of patients with cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Spousal caregivers (SCGs) of patients with cognitive impairment are predisposed to an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Homocysteine and folate levels are potential modifiable biomarkers for these risks, given their associations with cardiovascular and cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association of the caregiving burden with homocysteine and folate levels in SCGs. METHODS: This study included 107 SCGs and their care recipients who visited the Chungnam National University Hospital between May 2020 and May 2023. The caregiving burden was quantified using the Zarit Burden Interview, and blood assays were performed after overnight fasting. We adjusted for the age and sex of SCGs and the clinical diagnosis of care recipients as covariates. RESULTS: The caregiving burden of SCGs showed a significant positive correlation with their homocysteine level (β = 0.219, t = 2.165, p = 0.033). In contrast, caregiving burden and folate showed an inverse correlation (β = -0.207, t = -1.997, p = 0.049). Furthermore, the association between caregiving burden and homocysteine levels remained significant after including vascular risk score and physical activity level as covariates (p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the caregiving burden of SCGs in individuals with cognitive impairment is associated with elevated homocysteine levels and low folate levels, potentially exacerbating the risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring homocysteine and folate as modifiable biomarkers to address and potentially mitigate health risks in SCGs.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports

It remains unclear whether hypertension modulates their relationship. This cross-sectional study investigates whether hypertension moderates the relationship between plasma Aβ and cognitive impairment (CI). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1488 subjects ≥ 40 years from rural areas of northwestern China. CI was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score lower than the cutoff. Firstly, plasma Aβ(40), Aβ(42), Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) were analyzed as restricted cubic spline. Then, categories of combined plasma Aβ were created by making bisection of plasma Aβ according to average and combining them as L-Aβ(40) and L-Aβ(42), H-Aβ(40) and L-Aβ(42), L-Aβ(40) and H-Aβ(42), H-Aβ(40) and H-Aβ(42). Decreased plasma Aβ(40) was defined as < 25th percentile. Multivariate logistic regression examined the relationship between plasma Aβ and CI in total population, the hypertension subgroup and the non-hypertension subgroup. RESULTS: 737 participants (49.5%) had hypertension and 189 participants (12.7%) had CI. Simultaneously elevated plasma Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) was associated with CI in hypertension (H-Aβ(40) and H-Aβ(42) vs. L-Aβ(40) and L-Aβ(42), 21.1% vs.10.7%, P = 0.033; OR = 1.984 [95% CI, 1.067-3.691], P = 0.030) but not in the non-hypertension. Decreased plasma Aβ(40) was associated with CI in the non-hypertension (14.9% vs. 9.2%, P = 0.026; OR = 1.728 [95% CI, 1.018-2.931], P = 0.043) but not in the hypertension. CONCLUSION: Hypertension is an important modulator in the relationship between plasma Aβ and CI. Simultaneously elevated plasma Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) in the hypertension, and decreased plasma Aβ(40) in the non-hypertension, may be risk factors for CI. These findings emphasize the need to consider hypertension in CI detection.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
40264648,Associations between blood selenium and serum neurofilament light chain: results of a nationwide survey.,"BACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is essential for many nervous system functions including memory, cognition and coordination, which has also been linked to a variety of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a biomarker of neurologic diseases. Studies on the relationship between blood Se and sNfL are limited. METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 data were employed to perform multivariate linear regression analysis and smooth curve fitting in order to investigate the relationship between blood Se and sNfL. Utilizing subgroup analyses and interaction tests, the stability of this relationship between populations was evaluated. RESULTS: sNfL and blood Se had an inverse relationship in 1,036 individuals who were older than 20. According to the fully adjusted model, the sNfL decreased by 54.75 pg./mL for every unit increase in log blood Se [β = -54.75, 95% CI (-75.36, -34.14)]. The sNfL of individuals in the highest blood Se quartile decreased by 3.4 pg./mL in comparison to those in the lowest quartile [β = -3.40, 95% CI (-6.47, -0.32)]. This inverse association was more significant in those who were younger than 60 years old, male, normal weight, had a history of smoking and drinking. CONCLUSION: Blood Se is inversely associated with sNfL in American adults. Our findings indicate that blood Se may have a potential protective effect against neuronal damage.",Frontiers in neurology
40115030,Glymphatic function decline as a mediator of core memory-related brain structures atrophy in aging.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate the role of the glymphatic system-a crucial pathway for clearing waste in the brain-in the aging process and its contribution to cognitive decline. We specifically focused on the diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index as a noninvasive biomarker of glymphatic function. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and a separate validation cohort to analyze the ALPS index in cognitively normal older adults. The relationships among the ALPS index, brain morphometry, and memory performance were examined. RESULTS: As a biomarker of glymphatic function, the ALPS index appeared to decline with age in both cohorts. According to the brain morphology analysis, the ALPS index was positively correlated with the thickness of the left entorhinal cortex (r = 0.258, P (false discovery rate (FDR)) = 2.96 × 10(-4)), and it played a mediating role between aging and left entorhinal cortex thinning. The independent cohort further validated the correlation between the ALPS index and the left entorhinal cortex thickness (r = 0.414, P (FDR) = 0.042). Additionally, in both the primary and validation cohorts, the ALPS index played a significant mediating role in the relationship between age and durable or delayed memory decline. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the ALPS index as a promising biomarker for glymphatic function and links it to atrophy of the core memory brain regions during aging. Furthermore, these results suggest that targeting glymphatic dysfunction could represent a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate age-related memory decline.",Journal of translational internal medicine
39921274,Three-Objects-Three-Places Episodic Memory Test to Screen Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Dementia: Validation in a Memory Clinic Population.,"BACKGROUND: The Three-Objects-Three-Places (3O3P) test is a 5-min screen for episodic memory impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, known for its briefness and easy administration, culture- and language-free nature, and the absence of specific equipment. However, no studies have validated its potential in memory clinic cohorts. The aim of this study was to test its convergent, discriminant, and known-group validities and to define thresholds for its clinical use. METHODS: We included 2062 cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia patients from the Geneva Memory Center cohort who underwent the 3O3P test in the context of clinical practice. Convergent and discriminant validities were assessed using an exploratory factor analysis. The known-group validity was assessed in CU vs. MCI and dementia using the area under the curve (AUC). 3O3P test scores vs. amyloid and tau positivity, neurodegeneration, and cognition (ATNC) were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The 3O3P test cut-offs were calculated using sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy. RESULTS: Mean age was 72 years (SD = 11), 60% were female, mean education was 13 years (SD = 4), and mean MMSE was 25 (SD = 5). The 3O3P and Delayed Total Recall tests loaded strongly on the ""memory"" factor and weakly on ""non-memory"" factors. The 3O3P test can discriminate CU vs. MCI (AUC = 0.71) and dementia (AUC = 0.92). Higher 3O3P scores were associated with lower prevalence of ATNC (p < 0.001). A 3O3P value of 7 can detect MCI and dementia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 3O3P test has demonstrated good convergent, discriminant, and known-group validity in a large memory clinic population.",European journal of neurology
40004464,Genomic and Transcriptomic Approaches Advance the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), represent a growing societal challenge due to their irreversible progression and significant impact on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Despite advances in clinical and imaging-based diagnostics, these diseases are often detected at advanced stages, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Recent breakthroughs in genomic and transcriptomic technologies, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and CRISPR-based screens, have revolutionized the field, offering new avenues for early diagnosis and personalized prognosis. Genomic approaches have elucidated disease-specific genetic risk factors and molecular pathways, while transcriptomic studies have identified stage-specific biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and severity. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), and spatial transcriptomics are enabling the stratification of patients based on their risk profiles and prognostic trajectories. Advances in functional genomics have uncovered actionable targets, such as ATXN2 in ALS and TREM2 in AD, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies. Despite these achievements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into clinical practice due to disease heterogeneity and the complexity of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Future integration of genetic technologies holds promise for transforming diagnostic and prognostic paradigms, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and precision medicine approaches.",Genes
39959359,Clinical performance of the fully automated Lumipulse plasma p-tau217 assay in mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 is a leading blood-biomarker for the detection of amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology. We assessed the performance of a fully automated plasma p-tau217 immunoassay to detect Aβ pathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/mild dementia. METHODS: Paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) in a specialist memory service. Plasma p-tau217 was measured using the Lumipulse immunoassay platform and ability to detect CSF-defined Aβ positivity assessed. RESULTS: Of 148 participants (69.4 ± 6.5 years; 54.1% female), 101 had MCI and 47 mild dementia. Median plasma p-tau217 was > 4-fold higher in Aβ+ vs Aβ- individuals with an area under the curve of 0.92 (0.87-0.97). Application of 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity/specificity thresholds for plasma p-tau217 may have obviated the need for more than half of LPs. DISCUSSION: Our real-world data support the clinical use of fully automated plasma p-tau217 immunoassays, although further studies in more diverse cohorts are required. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 was measured using a fully automated immunoassay (Lumipulse).P-tau217 was > 4-fold higher in amyloid beta (Aβ)+ versus Aβ- individuals.Plasma p-tau217 had an area under the curve of 0.92 for detection of Aβ status.Using a previously proposed two-threshold approach may avoid more than half of lumbar punctures.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40453669,Circular RNAs as disease modifiers of complex neurologic disorders.,"Circular RNAs are a large class of non-coding RNA molecules, conserved across species and produced by back-splicing. While their molecular functions are still elusive, the ones primarily retained in the nucleus are usually associated to regulation of transcription and mRNA processing patterns. Instead, the majority, are transported to the cytoplasm where they elicit micro-RNA (miRNA) or RNA binding protein (RBP)-sponging functions, or could be translated. CircRNAs are abundantly expressed in brain tissue, where they do not only act as regulators of brain development and physiology, but can also contribute to complex neurological conditions. In fact, deregulated circRNA expression levels were described in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Because of their described roles in pathology, these molecules may not only represent possible disease bio-markers, but they could even function as disease modifiers. As such, they could be targeted or protected in search of novel routes of therapeutic intervention. In this review, we highlight recent developments in the field, first discussing circRNAs involved in physiologic brain development and function, then reviewing studies that implicate circRNAs in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, with major attention to experimental studies exploring circRNA function and their role in neuropathologic processes. Such experimental strategies are mainly based on depletion or over-expression approaches and provide important insights into the modulatory potential of these molecules. They are relevant for clinical translation of basic research findings to drug development, possibly generating a positive impact for patients' quality of life.",Frontiers in pharmacology
39991517,Apolipoprotein E: A Potential Prognostic and Diagnostic Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is one of the strongest genetic determinants of the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may also increase the risk of cancer. However, its importance goes far beyond this. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the potential role and prognostic value of APOE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using bioinformatics and multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mIHC). METHODS: Clinicopathologic samples from 90 hCC patients enrolled between April 2007 and June 2012 were included in this study. Researchers used tissue microarrays (HLiv180Su09) and multiple fluorescent immunohistochemical analyses to validate APOE protein expression and patient prognosis. Several online databases were used to investigate APOE expression and prognosis in HCC, followed by a comprehensive analysis of correlations between APOE and clinicopathologic features, immune cell infiltration levels, immune checkpoint genes, mutations, and functional enrichment analysis. The distribution of APOE in immune cell populations was also determined using a single-cell database. RESULTS: APOE mRNA was significantly overexpressed in HCC at both transcriptional and translational levels. Survival analysis suggested that APOE might be a favorable prognostic indicator for HCC patients. In addition to its involvement in immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, genetic variation, immunomodulatory genes, and methylation alterations in HCC, enrichment analysis showed that APOE was involved in multiple cancer-related signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively examines the critical role of APOE in HCC and highlights its significant potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. This finding not only paves the way for new avenues of research in HCC, but also provides valuable insights into clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.",Journal of hepatocellular carcinoma
39802805,Alzheimer Disease Plasma Biomarkers in the Mid-Western Amish.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) plasma biomarkers are noninvasive measures of the key amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies. Validation and generalization studies are needed to fully understand their potential for AD prediction and diagnosis in the elderly population. METHODS: In 1,067 Amish individuals aged ≥ 65, we measured plasma Aβ and tau to assess their relationships with AD-related outcomes. RESULTS: Among Amish individuals with AD, plasma p-tau181 was significantly higher ( p = 0.04), and plasma Aβ42/p-tau181 ratio was significantly lower ( p = 0.01) than cognitively normal individuals. The association of AD with elevated p-tau181 was driven by APOE ε4 carriers (OR = 6.02, p < 0.001). Cluster analysis identified two subgroups defined by differing Aβ and tau levels, with the high-risk cluster having more APOE ε4 carriers ( p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau181, Aβ42/Aβ40, and Aβ42/p- tau181 ratio, are promising surrogate biomarkers for AD-related pathology and clinical outcomes in the Amish.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
40195962,Intranasal insulin in Alzheimer disease (diabetes in situ?): a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Evidence suggests that AD shares pathophysiological similarities with type 2 diabetes. Intranasal insulin (INI) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for AD by directly targeting the brain and modulating insulin signaling pathways. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of INI therapy for AD through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: A search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase, was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to June 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed original research articles focused on humans, investigating the therapeutic effects of INI administration on cognitive impairment associated with AD, and reporting quantitative data on cognitive outcomes, biomarkers, or pathological markers relevant to AD. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the effects of INI on cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 647 articles were identified, and eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall odds ratio was 3.75 (95%CI 1.49-9.40). The test for overall effect showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). However, the I(2) value indicated a high level of heterogeneity (85.5%), suggesting significant variability among the studies. CONCLUSION: While the current data is not yet conclusive enough to definitively establish INI as a standard treatment for AD, the evidence supporting its safety, efficacy, and reduced risk of systemic side effects suggests potential cognitive benefits for improving global cognition in patients with AD.",Dementia & neuropsychologia
39881680,MicroRNAs signatures as potential molecular markers in mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by a decline in cognitive functioning without significant interference in daily activities. Its high heterogeneity and elevated conversion rate to dementia pose challenges for accurate diagnosis and monitoring, highlighting the urgent need to identify methodologies focused on the early detection and intervention of MCI. Due to their biological characteristics, microRNAs (miRNAs) are potential candidates as non-invasive molecular markers for the identification and assessment of MCI progression. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the miRNAs commonly deregulated in MCI, focusing on expression profiles in plasma, serum, and extracellular vesicle samples. Our analysis identified eight upregulated miRNAs, including hsa-miR-149-3p, and four downregulated miRNAs, such as Let-7f-5p. Notably, hsa-miR-149-3p emerged as a central node in interaction networks, suggesting its crucial role in regulating cellular processes relevant to MCI. Additionally, pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation and neurodegeneration. Our results underscore the potential of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive molecular markers for MCI and open the possibility for new methodologies that enable more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Validating the expression of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-149-3p and Let-7f-5p, along with identifying their functional role in the specific context of MCI, is essential to establish their biological relevance. This work contributes to the understanding of the miRNA profile in mild cognitive impairment using easily accessible samples, which could be useful for the development of various strategies aimed at preventing or delaying MCI in individuals at risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39864834,Growth and differentiation factor 15: An emerging therapeutic target for brain diseases.,"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a member of the transforming growth factor-βsuperfamily, is considered a stress response factor and has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to its roles in neurological diseases. Although many studies have suggested that GDF15 expression is elevated in patients with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), glioma, and ischemic stroke, the effects of increased GDF15 expression and the potential underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Notably, many experimental studies have shown the multidimensional beneficial effects of GDF15 on NDDs, and GDF15 overexpression is able to rescue NDD-associated pathological changes and phenotypes. In glioma, GDF15 exerts opposite effects, it is both protumorigenic and antitumorigenic. The causes of these conflicting findings are not comprehensively clear, but inhibiting GDF15 is helpful for suppressing tumor progression. GDF15 is also regarded as a biomarker of poor clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke patients, and targeting GDF15 may help prevent this disease. Thus, we systematically reviewed the synthesis, transcriptional regulation, and biological functions of GDF15 and its related signaling pathways within the brain. Furthermore, we explored the potential of GDF15 as a therapeutic target and assessed its clinical applicability in interventions for brain diseases. By integrating the latest research findings, this study provides new insights into the future treatment of neurological diseases.",Bioscience trends
39876667,Differential Neurotoxicity Induced in Rats by Injection of PMs from 31 Major Cities in China.,"The effects of particulate matter (PMs) from different cities on the nervous system remain unclear. In this study, aqueous solutions of 0.45 μm membrane-filtered PM from 31 major Chinese cities were intravenously administered to rats. Neurotoxicity and mechanisms were investigated by quantifying rat behavior, analyzing in vivo biomarkers, and examining the PM physicochemical properties. PMs from different cities had variable impacts on rat responses, as manifested by the movement speed of the right ear, particularly at 1 h and 4-6 days postexposure. Physiological mechanisms were linked to the regulation of glucocorticoids via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and miR-107/miR-124 expression in the blood. Additionally, PM toxicity was strongly influenced by particle morphology, size, and zeta potential, which varied greatly across cities. Using random forest and multiple linear regression, we revealed that PM particle sizes (458.67 and 531.17 nm) and PM zeta potentials (-3.78, -17.01, and -20.31 mV) had the most important impacts on rat responsiveness, which was in line with blood biomarkers levels in rats such as Glucocorticoid, IL-1β, and IFN-α. These findings indicate that PMs from 31 cities contribute to varying neurotoxicity, thus presenting a possible differential burden on Alzheimer's disease in the aging population across many different regions.",Environmental science & technology
39129050,Sex-specific clinical and neurobiological correlates of fatigue in older adults.,"Fatigue is a common and distressful symptom in older people and has been associated with adverse health outcomes. Nevertheless, its sex-specific pathophysiological underpinnings and clinical correlates have been scarcely investigated. We aimed to comprehensively explore the clinical and neurobiological determinants of fatigue in cognitively unimpaired older adults. A sex-stratified analysis was conducted to look for differences in the clinical expression of fatigue among women and men. Data on cognitively normal individuals were gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 study. Fatigue was defined based on self-report at baseline. For each participant, information on sociodemographics, comorbidities, mood, cognitive performance, frailty, and biomarkers of brain pathology was collected. Logistic regression models, stratified by sex, were conducted to explore the factors associated with fatigue. Among the 291 participants selected, 44 subjects (15.1% of the total sample) self-reported fatigue at baseline. Subjects reporting fatigue were more likely women, had higher frailty degrees, and more severe depressive symptoms than those without fatigue. Moreover, they tended to have lower MRI hippocampus volumes. Among women, those reporting fatigue exhibited higher frailty levels, worse depression, and lower MRI hippocampus volumes relative to those without fatigue. Higher frailty degrees were also observed in men reporting vs. non-reporting fatigue. In the adjusted logistic regression model, more severe depression (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.28; p < 0.01) and lower MRI hippocampus volumes (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.90; p = 0.03) resulted independently associated with fatigue in women, while higher frailty degrees (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.27-7.54 per 0.1 increase in a 39-item Frailty index; p = 0.01) in men. Fatigue is a complex symptom with a sex-specific pattern of clinical and neurobiological correlates. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these associations is warranted to develop sex-informed approaches for personalized treatments.",GeroScience
39892295,[Neuropsychological markers and factors associated with amnesic mild cognitive impairment].,"BACKGROUND: Mild amnestic cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a syndrome in which there are cognitive deficits characterized by memory complaints, with the endophenotype with the highest rate of conversion to dementia, especially the Alzheimer type. The objective of the study was to establish neuropsychological markers and factors associated with aMCI. METHODS: Transversal descriptive study with case and control analysis, with a sample of 426 subjects selected by non-probabilistic convenience sampling. The average age was 58.8±5.5 years, 57.3% (244) of the sample were women, and 184 subjects (43.2%) had university studies. The clinical history shows that 47.9% (204) had a clinical history of hypertension, followed by symptoms of depression with 37.6% (160) and a tendency to isolation with 28.6% (122). Information on neuropsychological markers and associated factors was obtained through a neuropsychological assessment protocol. RESULTS: In the aMCI group, the domains of: focused care (OR: 10.74 95% CI 3.386-34.11) were found as significantly associated factors with respect to subjects without apparent pathology; episodic memory (storage) (OR: 36.52 95% CI 15.14-88.05) and denomination (OR: 5.043 95% CI 1.816-14.00). CONCLUSIONS: Focused attention, episodic memory (storage) and naming become neuropsychological markers associated with aMCI; likewise, social isolation is shown to be a factor associated with aMCI when compared to subjects with non-amnestic predominant mild cognitive impairment (anMCI).",Revista espanola de geriatria y gerontologia
40092369,Unraveling the role of proteins in dementia: insights from two UK cohorts with causal evidence.,"Population-based proteomics offers a groundbreaking avenue to predict future disease risks, enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, and discover novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The role of plasma proteins in dementia, however, requires further exploration. This study investigated 276 protein-dementia associations in 229 incident all-cause dementia, 89 Alzheimer's disease, and 41 vascular dementia among 3249 participants (55% women, 97.2% white ethnicity) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) over a median 9.8-year follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazard regression for the analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to assess the precision of the identified proteins from the fully adjusted Cox regression models in predicting incident all-cause dementia, both individually and in combination with demographic predictors, APOE genotype, and memory score, to estimate the area under the curve. Additionally, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm was used to identify the most important features predictive of future all-cause dementia onset. These associations were then validated in 1506 incident all-cause dementia, 732 Alzheimer's disease, 281 vascular dementia, and 111 frontotemporal dementia cases among 52 745 individuals (53.9% women, 93.3% White ethnicity) from the UK Biobank over a median 13.7-year follow-up. Two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization and drug target Mendelian randomization were further employed to determine the causal direction between protein concentration and dementia. NEFL (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]: 1.54 [1.29, 1.84]) and RPS6KB1 (HR [95% CI]: 1.33 [1.16, 1.52]) were robustly associated with incident all-cause dementia; MMP12 (HR [95% CI]: 2.06 [1.41, 2.99]) was associated with vascular dementia in ELSA, after correcting for multiple testing. Additional markers EDA2R and KIM1 were identified from subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Combining NEFL and RPS6KB1 with other predictors yielded high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.871) for incident all-cause dementia. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm also identified RPS6KB1, NEFL, and KIM1 as the most important protein features for predicting future all-cause dementia. Sex difference was evident for the association between RPS6KB1 and all-cause dementia, with stronger association in men (P for interaction = 0.037). Replication in the UK Biobank confirmed the associations between the identified proteins and various dementia subtypes. The results from Mendelian randomization in the reverse direction indicated that several proteins serve as early markers for dementia, rather than being direct causes of the disease. These findings provide insights into putative mechanisms for dementia. Future studies are needed to validate the findings on RPS6KB1 in relation to dementia risk.",Brain communications
39830238,The Dynamics of Cognitive Decline towards Alzheimer's Disease Progression: Results from ADSP-PHC's Harmonized Cognitive Composites.,"INTRODUCTION: Accurately assessing temporal order of cognitive decline across multiple domains is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing literature presented controversial conclusions likely due to the use of a single cohort and different analytical strategies. METHODS: Harmonized composite cognitive measures in memory, language and executive functions from 13 cohorts in the ADSP-PHC data are used. A novel double anchoring events-based sigmoidal mixed model was developed using time to the incident of AD diagnosis as the time scale. RESULTS: Decline in memory occurred before decline in language which was followed by the decline in executive function. Throughout the entire AD continuum, APOE-ε4 non-carriers and non-Hispanic Whites showed better memory performance, respectively, in all three cognitive domains. DISCUSSION: Using harmonized data across multiple cohorts is the key to accurately characterizing the temporal order of AD biomarkers. Time to incident AD diagnosis should be used as the time scale for reproducibility purposes.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
40385290,"Small HSPs at the crossroad between protein aggregation, autophagy and unconventional secretion: clinical implications and potential therapeutic opportunities in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.","Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as ataxias and fronto-temporal disorders are all characterized by the progressive accumulation of protein aggregates (amyloids) into inclusions bodies. In addition, recent experimental evidence is challenging the conventional view of the disease by revealing the ability of some of these disease-relevant proteins to be transferred between cells by means of extracellular vesicles (EVs), allowing the mutant protein to seed oligomers involving both the mutant and wild type forms of the protein. Abnormal secretion and levels of EVs are closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to disease progression. Numerous studies have proposed EVs as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize and discuss the role of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and autophagy in cellular quality control and turn-over of the major aggregation-prone proteins associated to neurodegenerative disorders. We also highlight the advanced research progress on mechanisms regulating unconventional secretion, secretory autophagy and EVs biogenesis and their contribution in the pathological processes underlining these diseases. Finally, we outline the latest research on the roles of EVs in neurodegenerative diseases and their potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance for the treatment of these clinically relevant conditions.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology
39721217,"Robust, fully-automated assessment of cerebral perivascular spaces and white matter lesions: a multicentre MRI longitudinal study of their evolution and association with risk of dementia and accelerated brain atrophy.","BACKGROUND: Perivascular spaces (PVS) on brain MRI are surrogates for small parenchymal blood vessels and their perivascular compartment, and may relate to brain health. However, it is unknown whether PVS can predict dementia risk and brain atrophy trajectories in participants without dementia, as longitudinal studies on PVS are scarce and current methods for PVS assessment lack robustness and inter-scanner reproducibility. METHODS: We developed a robust algorithm to automatically assess PVS count and size on clinical MRI, and investigated 1) their relationship with dementia risk and brain atrophy in participants without dementia, 2) their longitudinal evolution, and 3) their potential use as a screening tool in simulated clinical trials. We analysed 46,478 clinical measurements of cognitive functioning and 20,845 brain MRI scans from 10,004 participants (71.1 ± 9.7 years-old, 56.6% women) from three publicly available observational studies on ageing and dementia (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database, and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). Clinical and MRI data collected between 2004 and 2022 were analysed with consistent methods, controlling for confounding factors, and combined using mixed-effects models. FINDINGS: Our fully-automated method for PVS assessment showed excellent inter-scanner reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.8). Fewer PVS and larger PVS diameter at baseline predicted higher dementia risk and accelerated brain atrophy. Longitudinal trajectories of PVS markers differed significantly in participants without dementia who converted to dementia compared with non-converters. In simulated placebo-controlled trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline, screening out participants at low risk of dementia based on our PVS markers enhanced the power of the trial independently of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. INTERPRETATION: These robust cerebrovascular markers predict dementia risk and brain atrophy and may improve risk-stratification of patients, potentially reducing cost and increasing throughput of clinical trials to combat dementia.

39885592,"Hyperhomocysteinemia-induced VCID results in visual deficits, reduced neuroinflammation and vascular alterations in the retina.","Over recent years, the retina has been increasingly investigated as a potential biomarker for dementia. A number of studies have looked at the effect of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology on the retina and the associations of AD with visual deficits. However, while OCT-A has been explored as a biomarker of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), studies identifying the specific retinal changes and mechanisms associated with cSVD are lacking. Using our model of hyperhomocysteinemia-induced cSVD, we aimed to identify the effects of cSVD on visual sensitivity and cognition, retinal glial and vascular cells, and neuroinflammatory and cardiovascular gene expression changes. We placed C57Bl6/SJL mice on a HHcy-inducing diet, a model that has been well characterized to have vascular pathologies in the brain similar to pathologic cSVD. After 14 weeks on diet, mice underwent the Visual-Stimuli 4-arm Maze to identify visual deficits. Whole mount retinas were stained for vessels, microglia and astrocytes to identify glial and vascular changes. Finally, neuroinflammatory and cardiovascular gene expression was measured using NanoString's nCounter system. Ultimately, HHcy led to visual changes that specifically affected the reaction to blue and white light, slightly decreased vascular volume and significantly decreased interaction of microglia with the vasculature, as well as downregulation of inflammatory and vascular genes. These changes provide novel insights and reproduce some prior observations. These studies highlight retinal changes in association with cSVD and serve as a precaution when interpreting vision-dependent cognitive testing of cSVD models.",Journal of neuroinflammation
39827682,Association between glymphatic system function and cognitive impairment in elderly patients with late-onset epilepsy.,"PURPOSE: Recent studies have shown that late-onset epilepsy (LOE) is accompanied with cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the cognitive decline in LOE remains unclear. The aim of current study was to evaluate the relationship between glymphatic system (GS) function and cognitive decline in LOE patients using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS). METHODS: Medical records and neuro-imaging data were obtained from 21 LOE patients with cognitive decline, 14 LOE patients without cognitive decline, and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Plasma biomarkers including Aβ42 and Aβ40 were examined using single-molecule array (Simoa) assays. The DTI-ALPS parameter was calculated and correlated with the clinical characteristics of LOE, including age, seizure frequency, duration of epilepsy, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Aβ42/40. Regression models were used to evaluate the influencing factors of DTI-ALPS index. RESULTS: LOE patients exhibited a decreased ALPS index and Aβ42/40 compared with the HCs. Post-hoc analysis indicated that the DTI-ALPS index and Aβ42/40 in LOE patients with cognitive decline was significantly lower in relative to LOE patients without cognitive decline and HCs. Spearman correlations showed a negative correlation between DTI-ALPS index and age, seizure frequency and disease duration while a positive correlations between the DTI-ALPS index and Aβ42/40 and MMSE scores in LOE patients. Linear regression analysis suggested that the DTI-ALPS index was independently related to age, Aβ42/40 and MMSE score after correcting for gender, education, and vascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: Our findings using DTI-ALPS method found a positive correlation between cognitive decline and GS dysfunction in LOE patients, and may indicate a potential internal link between age-related LOEU and dementia formation. Therefore, the DTI-ALPS index may serve as a potential imaging marker for diagnosing and monitoring the GS function in LOE patients.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B
39973500,A possible pathway to freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.,"Freezing of gait (FOG), a common, perplexing gait disorder observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), is a leading cause of injurious falls and contributes significantly to social isolation. Unlike other PD cardinal features, FOG appears to develop independently, and its heterogeneity presents challenges for both definition and measurement. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FOG remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective treatments. Although the roles of specific, targetable biomarkers in FOG development remain unidentified, evidence suggests that it is likely multimodal, potentially involving extranigral transmitter circuits. The diversity of FOG phenotypes may also reflect underlying differences in pathophysiology. In this paper, we first present evidence that FOG may occur independently of dopaminergic influence. We then review an expanding body of research supporting the hypothesis that FOG arises from a dysfunctional pathophysiological feedback loop, involving norepinephrine (NE) depletion, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. This biological disruption occurs concurrently with, but distinct from, the primary dopaminergic pathology of PD. When they occur on the background of dopamine loss, the interactions between NE, Aβ, and inflammation, as observed in Alzheimer's disease models, may similarly play a critical role in the development of FOG in PD and could serve as pathobiological markers. The proposed changes in the pathophysiological loop might even precede its onset, highlighting the need for further investigation. A deeper understanding of the involvement of Aβ, NE, and inflammatory markers in FOG could pave the way for rapid clinical trials to test existing amyloid-clearing therapies and noradrenergic drugs in appropriate patient populations.",Journal of Parkinson's disease
39967803,Hyperthermia and targeting heat shock proteins: innovative approaches for neurodegenerative disorders and Long COVID.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and Long COVID represent critical and growing global health challenges, characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms including neuronal deterioration, protein misfolding, and persistent neuroinflammation. The emergence of innovative therapeutic approaches, such as whole-body hyperthermia (WBH), offers promising potential to modulate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in NDs and related conditions like Long COVID. WBH, particularly in fever-range, enhances mitochondrial function, induces heat shock proteins (HSPs), and modulates neuroinflammation-benefits that pharmacological treatments often struggle to replicate. HSPs such as HSP70 and HSP90 play pivotal roles in protein folding, aggregation prevention, and cellular protection, directly targeting pathological processes seen in NDs like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Preliminary findings also suggest WBH's potential to alleviate neurological symptoms in Long COVID, where persistent neuroinflammation and serotonin dysregulation are prominent. Despite the absence of robust clinical trials, the therapeutic implications of WBH extend to immune modulation and the restoration of disrupted physiological pathways. However, the dual nature of hyperthermia's effects-balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses-emphasizes the need for dose-controlled applications and stringent patient monitoring to minimize risks in vulnerable populations. While WBH shows potential interest, significant challenges remain. These include individual variability in response, limited accessibility to advanced hyperthermia technologies, and the need for standardized clinical protocols. Future research must focus on targeted clinical trials, biomarker identification, and personalized treatment strategies to optimize WBH's efficacy in NDs and Long COVID. The integration of WBH into therapeutic paradigms could mark a transformative step in addressing these complex conditions.",Frontiers in neuroscience
39862163,Discovery of an Enzyme-Activated Fluorogenic Probe for In Vivo Profiling of Acylaminoacyl-Peptide Hydrolase.,"Acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase (APEH), a serine peptidase that belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) family, catalyzes removal of N-terminal acetylated amino acid residues from peptides. As a key regulator of protein N-terminal acetylation, APEH was involved in many important physiological processes while its aberrant expression was correlated with progression of various diseases such as inflammation, diabetics, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cancers. However, while emerging attention has been attracted in APEH-related disease diagnosis and drug discovery, the mechanisms behind APEH and related disease progression are still unclear; thus, further investigating the physiological role and function of APEH is of great importance. To date, enzyme-activated fluorescent probes targeting POPs have been extensively reported and adopted in relevant medical research and applications. Nevertheless, as an important member of the POP family, APEH was rarely referred in the field of bioimaging while the fluorescent probe for in vivo sensing of APEH activity has not been reported yet. Thus, acquiring an efficient APEH-targeted probe is in urgent need. Herein, an enzyme-activated fluorogenic probe for in vivo profiling of APEH was first discovered via a substrate mimic-based strategy. By combination of stimulated molecular docking-based preliminary screening and experiment-based secondary screening, the optimal probe (named as TMN-AcA), which displayed high binding affinity, sensitivity, and specificity toward APEH, was screened out. Owing to the superior properties of TMN-AcA, endogenous APEH activity in various cell lines and transplanted tumor could be visualized while tissue distribution of APEH was revealed. Most importantly, APEH was first demonstrated to be a potential biomarker of multiple-organ injury via TMN-AcA-based bioimaging and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis while the newly developed probe could serve as a vital tool for APEH-related disease diagnosis and biological function study.",Analytical chemistry
40018359,Research progress on brain network imaging biomarkers of subjective cognitive decline.,"PURPOSE: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an early manifestation of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, and accurately diagnosing SCD to differentiate it from neurotypical aging in older adults is a common challenge for researchers. METHODS: This review examines and summarizes relevant studies regarding the neuroimaging of the AD continuum, and comprehensively summarizes and outlines the SCD clinical features characterizing along with the corresponding neuroimaging changes involving structural, functional, and metabolic networks. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of SCD include a subjective decline in self-perceived cognitive function, and there are significant imaging changes, such as reductions in gray matter volume in certain brain regions, abnormalities in the integrity of white matter tracts and diffusion metrics, alterations in functional connectivity between different sub-networks or within networks, as well as abnormalities in brain metabolic networks and cerebral blood flow perfusion. CONCLUSION: The 147 referenced studies in this paper indicate that exploring the structural, functional, and metabolic network changes in the brain related to SCD through neuroimaging aims to enhance the goals and mission of brain science development programs: ""Understanding the Brain,"" ""Protecting the Brain,"" and ""Creating the Brain,"" thereby strengthening researchers' investigation into the mechanisms of brain function. Early diagnosis of SCD, along with prompt intervention, can reduce the incidence of AD spectrum while improving patients' quality of life, even integrating numerous scientific research achievements into unified and established standards and applying them in clinical practice by doctors, thus all encouraging researchers to further investigate SCD issues in older adults.",Frontiers in neuroscience
40553339,Artificial Intelligence-Based Genome Editing in CRISPR/Cas9.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a critical role in predicting and improving genome editing methods, including CRISPR/Cas9. Recently, several AI models, such as DeepCRISPR, CRISTA, and Deep High Fidelity (DeepHF), have been utilized to design guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas systems. These models assess genomic context, desired mutation type, on-target and off-target scores, and potential off-target locations. AI models help improve various genome editing methods, such as base, prime, and epigenome editing, which allow for precise and intentional changes to DNA sequences without the need for donor DNA templates. Furthermore, integrating AI with genome editing and precision medicine enables the creation of personalized treatments tailored to each individual's unique genetic profile. Examining genomic data enables the identification of mutations, variations, and biomarkers linked to diseases like cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Integrating AI with genome editing can potentially enhance genetic modification techniques' precision, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, it presents novel prospects for fields like genetics, biomedicine, and healthcare, which could significantly impact human health. However, several challenges still exist, including high costs, inaccurate edits, and effective delivery methods for CRISPR components, improved editing performance, and safety in clinical applications.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)"
39888585,Dynamic proportional loss of functional connectivity revealed change of left superior frontal gyrus in subjective cognitive decline: an explanatory study based on Chinese and Western cohorts.,"Brain network dynamics have been extensively explored in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). However, these studies are susceptible to individual differences, scanning parameters, and other confounding factors. Therefore, how to reveal subtle SCD-related subtle changes remains unclear. Cross-sectional and longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from both Chinese and Western populations were analyzed. We proposed a framework of dynamic proportional loss of functional connectivity (DPLFC). After its stability was validated, the optimal parameters were applied for the clinical diagnosis of SCD. DPLFC yielded a relatively high intraclass correlation coefficient. In particular, the DPLFC of the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) progressively decreased along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Compared with the traditional index, the DPLFC had better classification performance between cognitively normal controls and patients with SCD. Furthermore, DPLFC was related to Aβ deposition and scale scores. Patients with lower DPLFC values had a greater risk of cognitive decline. Decreased DPLFC in the left SFG may be a potential AD-related neuroimaging biomarker at an early stage.",GeroScience
40557143,Single-cell ligand-receptor profiling reveals an immunotherapy-responsive subtype and prognostic signature in triple-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of cancer that lacks specific targeted therapies. Although ligand-receptor (LR) interactions play a crucial role in intercellular communication and contribute to tumor heterogeneity, their molecular details and potential as prognostic or predictive markers in TNBC have not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data to categorize TNBC into 12 subgroups and 10 distinct cell types. From this dataset, we identified LR pairs that exhibited significant intercellular crosstalk and evaluated their prognostic relevance in a METABRIC TNBC cohort (n = 298). Through consensus clustering of these LR pairs, two molecular subtypes were defined. Key LR genes were then selected using Lasso regression and stepwise multivariate analysis to build an LR-based prognostic scoring system (LR.score), which was validated using both the METABRIC and GSE58812 datasets (n = 107). Additionally, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of the CXCL9/CXCR3 axis in MDA-MB-231 cells, confirming the knockdown via RT-qPCR and Western blot. The functional impact was assessed through proliferation, colony formation, and wound healing assays. RESULTS: One subtype (Clust1) demonstrated strong immune cell infiltration, higher immune scores, and enrichment in pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and KRAS signaling-indicative of a basal-like, immune-active phenotype. Among the LR pairs, the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis was identified as a key factor in immune cell recruitment and anti-tumor responses. Functionally, silencing the CXCL9/CXCR3 axis significantly diminished the proliferation, colony formation, and migratory capabilities of MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, a higher LR.score was correlated with poorer overall survival (HR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.12-2.56, P < 0.05) and reduced response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while patients with lower LR.score showed increased sensitivity to ICIs, particularly in anti-PD-L1 cohorts. CONCLUSION: The LR.score serves as an independent prognostic factor and a reliable predictor of immunotherapy response in TNBC. Targeting crucial LR interactions, especially the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis, may enhance immunotherapeutic efficacy and refine prognostic evaluations, paving the way for improved treatment strategies in TNBC.",Frontiers in immunology
39885961,The Spectrum of Genetic Risk in Alzheimer Disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common dementing syndrome in the United States, is currently established by the presence of amyloid-β and tau protein biomarkers in the setting of clinical cognitive impairment. These straightforward diagnostic parameters belie an immense complexity of genetic architecture underlying risk and presentation in AD. In this review, we provide a focused overview of the current state of AD genetics. We discuss the discovery of familial autosomal dominant genes, the identification of candidate genes associated with AD, and genetic variants conferring higher risk of developing AD compared with the general population. In particular, we discuss important features of AD risk due to the APOE ε4 allele. In addition to risk, we describe how the field has made headway understanding genetic factors that may protect from AD. The biological implications and practical limitations of information gleaned from genome-wide association studies in AD over the years are also discussed. The readers will have an up-to-date understanding of where we are in our efforts to understand the layers of genetic complexity in AD.",Neurology. Genetics
39910690,A Protocol for Determination of Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Biological Fluids by the High-Speed UHPLC-MS Method: Application on Transgenic Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat-24 Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Samples.,"Recently, proteinogenic amino acids have become very interesting molecules, accompanied by a large variety of metabolic processes in humans and are associated with various diseases. In the era of system biology, including a broad spectrum of associated disciplines (e.g., metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, etc.), the possibility of identifying trustworthy biomarkers of diseases becomes much more likely. Changes in amino acid levels in plasma, serum, or cerebrospinal fluid reflect physiological or pathological conditions and, therefore, their regular monitoring can lead to early detection of the occurrence of a disease. Therefore, the exact determination of amino acids in biological fluids is of great importance. However, it is necessary to dispose with an effective, accurate, precise, selective, and robust analytical method. This protocol describes the complex procedure of amino acid analysis based on a combination of UHPLC with single quadrupole MS. The protocol presents a highly reproducible and robust methodology that has already been established in the quality control of biopharmaceuticals and determination of proteinogenic amino acids in urine in our laboratory. Here, the application potential is extended to the most frequently investigated biological fluid, that is, plasma and to the cerebrospinal fluid, which is investigated in many neurological conditions.",Journal of separation science
39241972,Emerging insights into traditional Chinese medicine associated with neurodegenerative diseases: A bibliometric analysis.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Research suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds promise in offering innovative approaches to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. In our endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to delve into the landscape of TCM research within the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the present scenario, breadth, and trends in this field. This analysis presents potentially valuable insights for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine and provides compelling evidence supporting its efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. AIM OF THE STUDY: The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the rise, yet effective treatments are still lacking. Research indicates that TCM could offer novel perspectives for addressing neurodegenerative conditions. Nonetheless, the literature on this topic is intricate and multifaceted, with existing reviews offering only limited coverage. To gain a thorough understanding of TCM research in neurodegenerative diseases, we undertook a bibliometric analysis to explore the current status, scope, and trends in this area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was carried out on April 1, 2024, utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Visualization and quantitative analyses were then performed with the assistance of CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R software. RESULTS: A total of 6856 articles were retrieved in the search. Research on TCM for neurodegenerative diseases commenced in 1989 and has exhibited a notable overall growth since then. Main research contributors include East Asian countries like China, as well as the United States. Through our analysis, we identified 15 highly productive authors, 10 top-tier journals, 13 citation clusters, 11 influential articles, and observed a progression in keyword evolution across 4 distinct categories. In 2020, there was a significant upsurge in the knowledge base, collaboration efforts, and publication output within the field. This field is interdisciplinary: network pharmacology emerges as the cutting-edge paradigm in TCM research, while Alzheimer's disease remains a prominent focus among neurodegenerative conditions due to its evolving etiology. A burst detection analysis unveils that in 2024, the focal points of research convergence between TCM and neurodegenerative diseases lie in two key biological processes or mechanisms: autophagy and microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study quantitatively and visually captures the evolution of TCM in addressing neurodegenerative diseases, showcasing a notable acceleration in recent years. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of interdisciplinary collaboration and the necessity for increased global partnerships. Network pharmacology, leveraging the advancements of the big data era, embraces a holistic and systematic approach as a novel paradigm in exploring traditional Chinese medicine and unraveling their fundamental mechanisms. Three ethnomedical plants-Tianma, Renshen, and Wuweizi-demonstrate the promise of their bioactive compounds in treating neurodegenerative disorders, bolstered by their extensive historical usage for such ailments. Moreover, our intricate analysis of the evolutionary trajectories of key themes such as targets and biomarkers substantially enriches our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms involved.",Journal of ethnopharmacology
40340061,The cholinotrophic system in Down syndrome.,"Cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) projection neurons within the nucleus basalis and striatal cholinergic interneurons degenerate in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). However, the neuropathobiology of these diverse cholinergic phenotypes remains underinvestigated. This review summarizes the alterations of cholinergic, neurotrophic survival and cell death factors as well as tau pathology and amyloidopathy, and their effects upon these cell types in DS. In trisomy, the developing cholinergic system remains stable, whereas the neurotrophic receptors are compromised between control and DS cases. Both cholinergic neuronal phenotypes display severe cellular degeneration in both adult and the aged people with DS. Although developing cholinergic striatal neurons display a similar morphology between phenotypes, cholinergic striatal neurons appear dystrophic in adults with DS. Both cholinergic cell types display tau tangle pathology in elders with DS. Novel findings suggest that alterations in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid levels of proNGF, NGF metabolites, and select classes of neuronal genes are potential biomarkers to distinguish nondemented from demented people with DS. Compounds that target cholinergic pathways, TrkA agonists, p75(NTR)/proNGF small molecular antagonists, NGF metabolites, and select gene ontology classes are potential targets to slow degeneration of the CBF memory connectome in DS with translation to AD.",Handbook of clinical neurology
40391186,Cerebrovascular co-pathology and cholinergic white matter pathways along the Lewy body continuum.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies often presents with cholinergic degeneration and varying degrees of cerebrovascular disease. There is a lack of radiological methods for evaluating cholinergic degeneration in dementia with Lewy bodies. We investigated the potential of the Cholinergic Pathway Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS) in identifying cerebrovascular disease-related disruptions in cholinergic white matter pathways, offering a practical and accessible method for assessing cholinergic integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. We assessed the associations of CHIPS with regional brain atrophy, Alzheimer's disease co-pathology and clinical phenotype. Additionally, we compared its diagnostic performance to that of other manual and automated evaluation methods. We included 82 individuals (41 patients in the Lewy body continuum with either probable dementia with Lewy bodies or mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies, and 41 healthy controls) from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration cohort. We used CHIPS to assess cholinergic white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) on MRI, while tractography mean diffusivity provided a complementary measure of cholinergic WMSA. For global WMSA evaluation, we used the Fazekas scale and FreeSurfer. CHIPS successfully identified cerebrovascular disease-related disruptions in cholinergic white matter pathways, as evidenced by its association with tractography and global WMSA markers (P < 0.005 for all associations). Lewy body patients showed a significantly higher degree of WMSA in the external capsule cholinergic pathway despite no significant differences in global WMSA compared to controls. CHIPS score in the posterior external capsule and the mean diffusivity in the external capsule and cingulum exceeded the threshold for an optimal biomarker (sensitivity and specificity values above 80%) in discriminating Lewy body patients from controls. Furthermore, higher CHIPS scores, Fazekas scale and tractography mean diffusivity were associated with more pronounced frontal atrophy in Lewy body patients but not in controls. No associations were found for the four WMSA and integrity methods with the core clinical features, clinical or cognitive measures, or CSF biomarkers. In conclusion, cholinergic WMSA were more pronounced in Lewy body patients compared to healthy controls, independently of global WMSA. Our findings indicate that cerebrovascular disease-related disruptions in cholinergic white matter may be linked to frontal atrophy in Lewy body patients. Clinically, we demonstrate the potential of CHIPS to assess cholinergic WMSA using widely available MRI sequences. Our data suggest cerebrovascular disease co-pathology could drive the cholinergic degeneration in Lewy body patients, opening opportunities for therapeutic interventions targeting vascular health from mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies through manifest dementia with Lewy bodies.",Brain communications
38919069,"""There has to be more caring"": patient and care partner experiences of the disclosure of amyloid-β PET scan results.","OBJECTIVES: To explore patient and care partner experiences of receiving an amyloid scan result, with a focus on how clinician disclosure practices influenced patient and care partner emotional responses to the scan result and/or diagnosis. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 38 people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and 62 care partners who experienced the disclosure of results from an amyloid PET scan as part of the CARE-IDEAS study. We used thematic analysis to analyze interview transcripts. RESULTS: We identified four aspects of the disclosure process that could influence patient and care partner emotional experiences of the scan result/diagnosis: (1) mode of delivery, (2) presence of a care partner, (3) clarity of the scan result explanation, and (4) discussion of post-scan treatment and support options. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional experiences of an amyloid scan result can vary depending on how results are communicated. These findings support previous efforts to develop standard disclosure protocols. Scan results should be delivered in person with the care partner present. Clinicians should give a clear explanation of the result and its implications in an empathetic manner. Options for treatment and support should be discussed for all patients.",Aging & mental health
39881658,Sleep Patterns and Human Brain Health.,"It is a widely held opinion that sleep is important for human brain health. Here we examine the evidence for this view, focusing on normal variations in sleep patterns. We discuss the functions of sleep and highlight the paradoxical implications of theories seeing sleep as an adaptive capacity versus the theory that sleep benefits clearance of metabolic waste from the brain. We also evaluate the proposition that sleep plays an active role in consolidation of memories. Finally, we review research on possible effects of chronic sleep deprivation on brain health. We find that the evidence for a causal role of sleep in human brain health is surprisingly weak relative to the amount of attention to sleep in science and society. While there are well-established associations between sleep parameters and aspects of brain health, results are generally not consistent across studies and measures, and it is not clear to what extent alterations in sleep patterns represent symptoms or causes. Especially, the proposition that long sleep (>8 hours) in general is beneficial for long-term brain health in humans seems to lack empirical support. We suggest directions for future research to establish a solid foundation of knowledge about a role of sleep in brain health based on longitudinal studies with frequent sampling, attention to individual differences, and more ecologically valid intervention studies.","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and"
39918201,Genetic Markers of Postmortem Brain Iron.,"Brain iron (Fe) dyshomeostasis is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified plausible loci correlated with peripheral levels of Fe. Systemic organs and the brain share several Fe regulatory proteins but there likely exist different homeostatic pathways. We performed the first GWAS of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measures of postmortem brain Fe from 635 Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) participants. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with Fe in at least one of four brain regions were measured (p < 5 × 10(-8)). Promising SNPs (p < 5 × 10(-6)) were followed up for replication in published GWAS of blood, spleen, and brain imaging Fe traits and mapped to candidate genes for targeted cortical transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis of postmortem Fe in MAP. Results for SNPs previously associated with other Fe traits were also examined. Ninety-eight SNPs associated with postmortem brain Fe were at least nominally (p < 0.05) associated with one or more related Fe traits. Most novel loci identified had no direct links to Fe regulatory pathways but rather endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi trafficking (SORL1, SORCS2, MARCH1, CLTC), heparan sulfate (HS3ST4, HS3ST1), and coenzyme A (SLC5A6, PANK3); supported by nearest gene function and omic analyses. We replicated (p < 0.05) several previously published Fe loci mapping to candidate genes in cellular and systemic Fe regulation. Finally, novel loci (BMAL, COQ5, SLC25A11) and replication of prior loci (PINK1, PPIF, LONP1) lend support to the role of circadian rhythms and mitochondria function in Fe regulation more generally. In summary, we provide support for novel loci linked to pathways that may have greater relevance to brain Fe accumulation; some of which are implicated in neurodegeneration. However, replication of a subset of prior loci for blood Fe suggests that genetic determinants or biological pathways underlying Fe accumulation in the brain are not completely distinct from those of Fe circulating in the periphery.",Journal of neurochemistry
39746296,Towards the automatic detection of activities of daily living using eye-movement and accelerometer data with neural networks.,"Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, improves treatment and care outcomes for patients. Early signs of cognitive decline can be detected using functional scales, which are written records completed by a clinician or carer, detailing a patient's capability to perform routine activities of daily living. For example, tasks requiring planning, such as meal preparation, are some of the earliest affected by early mild cognitive impairment. In this article, we describe work towards the development of a system to automatically discriminate and objectively quantify activities of daily living. We train a selection of neural networks to discriminate a novel list of 14 activities, specially selected to overlap with those measured by existing functional scales. Our dataset consists of eight hours of development data captured from four individuals wearing the Continuous Ambulatory Vestibular Assessment (CAVA) device, which was originally developed to aid the diagnosis of vertigo. Using frequency domain recognition features derived from eye-movement and accelerometer data, we compare several classification approaches, including three bespoke neural networks, and two established network architectures commonly applied to time-series classification problems. In 10-fold cross-validation experiments, a peak mean accuracy of 64.1% is obtained. The highest accuracy across all folds is 75.3%, produced by networks comprising Gated Recurrent Units. The addition of eye-movement data is shown to improve discrimination compared to using accelerometer data alone, by close to 9%. Classification accuracy is shown to degrade if the system is trained such that test subjects are excluded from the training data, with the small size of the dataset given as a likely explanation. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of eye-movement data can significantly improve the discrimination of daily activities, and that neural networks are well suited to this task.",Computers in biology and medicine
39975899,"Isotope Encoded Spatial Biology Identifies Amyloid Plaque-Age-Dependent Structural Maturation, Synaptic Loss, and Increased Toxicity.","Understanding how amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques form and progress to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease remains a significant challenge. This study aims to elucidate the processes involved in Aβ plaque formation and maturation using a knock-in Aβ mouse model (App (NL-F/NL-F) ). By employing mass spectrometry imaging and stable isotope labeling, we timestamped Aβ plaques from their initial deposition, enabling the spatial tracking of plaque aging. Correlating single-plaque spatial transcriptomics with time since seeding, allowed us to track gene-expression changes specifically associated with plaque age, independent of chronological age of the mouse or disease severity. We found that plaque age, within sections from individual mice aged from 10 to 18 months, negatively correlates with synaptic gene expression. Further, correlation with hyperspectral confocal microscopy using structure-specific dyes revealed a positive link between plaque age and structural maturity, with older plaques identified as more compact and associated with significantly greater synapse loss and toxicity.",Research square
39794687,Physical activity and the outcome of cognitive trajectory: a machine learning approach.,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) may have an impact on cognitive function. Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used in dementia research, e.g., for diagnosis and risk stratification. Less is known about the value of ML for predicting cognitive decline in people with dementia (PwD). The aim of this study was to use an ML approach to identify variables associated with a multimodal PA intervention that may impact cognitive changes in PwD, i.e., by distinguishing between cognitive decliners and non-decliners. METHODS: This is a secondary, exploratory analysis using data from a Randomized Controlled Trial that included a 16-week multimodal PA intervention for the intervention group (IG) and treatment as usual for the control group (CG) in nursing homes. Predictors included in the ML models were related to the intervention (e.g., adherence), physical performance (e.g., mobility, balance), and pertinent health-related variables (e.g., health status, dementia form and severity). Primary outcomes were global and domain-specific cognitive performance (i.e., attention/ executive function, language, visuospatial skills, memory) assessed by standardized tests. A Support Vector Machine model was used to perform the classification of each primary outcome into the two classes of decline and non-decline. GridSearchCV with fivefold cross-validation was used for model training, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated to assess model performance. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 319 PwD (IG, N = 161; CG, N = 158). The proportion of PwD experiencing cognitive decline, in the different domains measured, ranged from 27-48% in CG, and from 23-49% in IG, with no statistically significant differences and no time*group effects. ML models showed accuracy and AUC values ranging from 40.6-75.6. The strongest predictors of cognitive decline or non-decline were performance of activities of daily living in IG and CG, and adherence and mobility in IG. CONCLUSIONS: ML models showed moderate performance, suggesting that the selected variables only had limited value for classification, with adherence and performance of activities of daily living appearing to be predictors of cognitive decline. While the study provides preliminary evidence of the potential use of ML approaches, larger studies are needed to confirm our observations and to include other variables in the prediction of cognitive decline, such as emotional health or biomarker abnormalities.",European review of aging and physical activity : official journal of the European
40070441,Distinct spatiotemporal atrophy patterns in corticobasal syndrome are associated with different underlying pathologies.,"Although the corticobasal syndrome was originally most closely linked with the pathology of corticobasal degeneration, the 2013 Armstrong clinical diagnostic criteria, without the addition of aetiology-specific biomarkers, have limited positive predictive value for identifying corticobasal degeneration pathology in life. Autopsy studies demonstrate considerable pathological heterogeneity in corticobasal syndrome, with corticobasal degeneration pathology accounting for only ∼50% of clinically diagnosed individuals. Individualized disease stage and progression modelling of brain changes in corticobasal syndrome may have utility in predicting this underlying pathological heterogeneity, and in turn improve the design of clinical trials for emerging disease-modifying therapies. The aim of this study was to jointly model the phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity of corticobasal syndrome, to identify unique imaging subtypes based solely on a data-driven assessment of MRI atrophy patterns and then investigate whether these subtypes provide information on the underlying pathology. We applied Subtype and Stage Inference, a machine learning algorithm that identifies groups of individuals with distinct biomarker progression patterns, to a large cohort of 135 individuals with corticobasal syndrome (52 had a pathological or biomarker defined diagnosis) and 252 controls. The model was fit using volumetric features extracted from baseline T1-weighted MRI scans and then used to subtype and stage follow-up scans. The subtypes and stages at follow-up were used to validate the longitudinal consistency of the baseline subtype and stage assignments. We then investigated whether there were differences in associated pathology and clinical phenotype between the subtypes. Subtype and Stage Inference identified at least two distinct and longitudinally stable spatiotemporal subtypes of atrophy progression in corticobasal syndrome; four-repeat-tauopathy confirmed cases were most commonly assigned to the Subcortical subtype (83% of individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy pathology and 75% of individuals with corticobasal-degeneration pathology), whilst those with Alzheimer's pathology were most commonly assigned to the Fronto-parieto-occipital subtype (81% of individuals). Subtype assignment was stable at follow-up (98% of cases), and individuals consistently progressed to higher stages (100% stayed at the same stage or progressed), supporting the model's ability to stage progression. By jointly modelling disease stage and subtype, we provide data-driven evidence for at least two distinct and longitudinally stable spatiotemporal subtypes of atrophy in corticobasal syndrome that are associated with different underlying pathologies. In the absence of sensitive and specific biomarkers, accurately subtyping and staging individuals with corticobasal syndrome at baseline has important implications for screening on entry into clinical trials, as well as for tracking disease progression.",Brain communications
40547480,Non-invasive biomarkers for brain aging: the role of autophagy-related microRNAs in plasma exosomes.,"AIM: This study aimed to identify autophagy-related microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma exosomes as non-invasive biomarkers for brain aging and explore their potential to improve early detection of age-associated neurodegeneration. With the increasing incidence of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), non-invasive diagnostic tools are urgently needed. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 200 individuals, divided into three groups, including young (20-40 years), middle-aged (41-60 years), and elderly (> 60 years). Exosomes were isolated, followed by small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed miRNAs, and differentially expressed miRNAs related to autophagy were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between autophagy-related miRNAs and brain aging biomarkers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance. RESULTS: Nine autophagy-related miRNAs were identified and validated as significantly upregulated in plasma exosomal from elderly, including hsa-miR-2110, hsa-miR-18a-3p, hsa-miR-766-3p, hsa-miR-4446-3p, hsa-miR-4667-5p, hsa-miR-4433b-3p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-423-5p, and novel_260. These miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. Correlation analysis showed that several of these miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-2110 and hsa-miR-766-3p, were strongly correlated with NfL (r = 0.68, p = 0.002), Aβ42 (r = 0.62, p = 0.004), and p-Tau181 (r = 0.55, p = 0.008). ROC curve analysis showed that combining these miRNAs with NfL resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92, outperforming NfL alone (AUC = 0.85) and miRNAs alone (AUC = 0.84). Further subgroup analysis revealed that multiple miRNAs, such as miR-2110, miR-4446-3p, and novel_260, achieved high AUCs (>0.83) in distinguishing middle-aged adults (41-60 years) from older adults (>60 years), supporting their potential utility for early detection of age-associated neurodegeneration. CONCLUSION: This study identifies a set of autophagy-related miRNAs as promising biomarkers for brain aging. The combination of these miRNAs with traditional biomarkers offers a non-invasive and highly sensitive method for early detection of brain aging, providing significant potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience
39944079,Sex difference in language cognition in the elderly group: a near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"SIGNIFICANCE: There are sex differences in the incidence and prevalence of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Whether this difference is already present in the preclinical stage of the disease is unclear. AIM: We aim to explore whether there are sex differences in brain functional activities of specific cognitive tasks in the elderly and identify sex-related biomarkers of specific cognitive functions, which may provide important references for the mechanism disclosure and clinical early screening and diagnosis of cognitive disorders. APPROACH: We measured global cerebral hemoglobin concentrations and connectivity in elderly male ( n = 45 ) and female ( n = 44 ) groups during the letter and category verbal fluency tasks. The sex differences in activation and connectivity and their relationship with task performance were explored. RESULTS: We found that there is a significant sex difference in connectivity, especially connectivity between the left inferior parietal and right prefrontal and left and right occipital in letter tasks, including the connectivity in parietal, left inferior parietal, and left occipital in category tasks. These connectivities were also significantly negatively correlated with the task performance of male groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated the connectivity between the left inferior parietal and right prefrontal, left and right occipital in letter tasks; the internal connectivity in the parietal; and the connectivity between parietal and the left inferior parietal and right occipital in category tasks may be crucial for verbal assessment of aging males. It is expected that the results will assist in cognitive assessment in the elderly group.",Neurophotonics
39822296,Toward alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay in clinical practice.,"INTRODUCTION: Seed amplification assays (SAAs) demonstrate remarkable diagnostic performance in alpha-synucleinopathies. However, existing protocols lack accessibility in routine laboratories, mainly due to the requirement for in-house production of recombinant alpha-synuclein (aSyn). This study proposes a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aSyn-SAA protocol using solely commercial reagents to facilitate its clinical implementation. METHODS: Routine clinical care CSF samples from 126 patients, comprising 47 with Lewy body diseases (LBD) (41 with dementia with Lewy bodies, six with Parkinson's disease), 37 without alpha-synucleinopathy, and 42 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), underwent assessment for aSyn-SAA activity. RESULTS: CSF aSyn-SAA showed a sensitivity of 72.3% and a specificity of 100% when distinguishing clinically diagnosed LBD patients from those without alpha-synucleinopathy. In AD patients, 14.3% were tested positive for aSyn. DISCUSSION: The commercial-only CSF aSyn-SAA protocol exhibited excellent specificity when applied to a real-life cohort, signaling progress toward the accessibility of an aSyn biomarker in clinical settings. HIGHLIGHTS: Diagnosis of LBD through aSyn-SAA lacks accessibility.This commercial-only aSyn-SAA has satisfactory performance in a real-life cohort.A negative aSyn-SAA does not completely exclude a synucleinopathy.Some technical points must be considered when developing aSyn-SAA.aSyn-SAA must be confined to expert laboratories due to prion-like risk management.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39827009,"Daily-life walking speed, running duration and bedtime from wrist-worn sensors predict incident dementia: A watch walk - UK biobank study.","OBJECTIVE: To determine if wrist-worn sensor parameters can predict incident dementia in individuals aged 60 + years and to compare prediction with other tools. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Community PARTICIPANTS: The cohort comprised 47,371 participants without dementia, aged 60 + years, who participated in the UK Biobank study (mean age=67 ± 4 years; 52 % female). MEASUREMENTS: Nineteen digital biomarkers were extracted from up-to-7-day wrist-worn sensor accelerometry data at baseline. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models examined associations between sensor parameters and prospectively diagnosed dementia. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7.5 years (interquartile range: 7.0 to 9.0 years), during this time 387 participants (0.8 %) were diagnosed with dementia. Among the gait parameters, slower maximal walking speed had the strongest association with incident dementia (32 % decrease in hazard for each standard deviation increase) followed by lower daily step counts (30 % decrease) and increased step-time variability (17 % increase). While adjusting for age and sex, running duration, maximal walking speed and early bedtime were identified as independent and significant predictors of dementia. The multivariable prediction model performed comparably to the ANU-ADRI and UKB-Dementia Risk Score models in the UK Biobank cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate that remotely acquired parameters from wrist-worn sensors can predict incident dementia. Since wrist-worn sensors are highly acceptable for long-term use, wrist-worn sensor parameters have the potential to be incorporated into dementia screening programs.",International psychogeriatrics
40236997,Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein as a biomarker of acute focal brain injury after high-intensity focused ultrasound thalamotomy.,"The validation of brain injury biomarkers has encountered challenges such as the absence of pre-insult measurements, variability in injury timing and location, and inter-individual differences. In this study, we addressed these limitations by using magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) thalamotomy to assess plasma biomarker changes after an acute focal brain injury. This prospective study included 30 essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients undergoing MRgHIFU thalamotomy at a single academic institution. Blood samples were collected at three specific time points: pre-procedure, 1-h post-procedure, and 48 h post-procedure. Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid beta (Aβ40 and Aβ42) and phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau-181) were measured using the quanterix single molecule arrays assay. GFAP levels were significantly increased at 48 h post-MRgHIFU in all patients with a thalamotomy lesion. GFAP levels at 48 h were highly sensitive (89.7%) and specific (96.6%) in detecting the presence of a lesion with a cut-off value of 216.2 pg/ml. NfL, Aβ40 and Aβ42, also showed statistically significant increases post-procedure but were less robust than GFAP. No changes were observed in pTau-181 levels post-MRgHIFU. Plasma GFAP has shown great promise as a sensitive and reliable biomarker for detecting acute brain injury after MRgHIFU thalamotomy. Its significant elevation following the procedure highlights its potential as a diagnostic tool for acute focal brain injuries, such as stroke. Further studies with additional time points are essential to validate the injury cut-off identified in this study and to assess its broader clinical utility for early detection of focal brain lesions.",Brain communications
40476255,Multiplex digital spatial profiling identifies subregion dependent targeted proteome changes across variants of dementia.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the leading cause of dementia in patients under the age of 65. Even in a single anatomical region, there is variance within pathological protein deposition within the FTLD spectrum, which drives difficulty in post-mortem clinicopathological diagnoses. We spatially multiplexed the proteome geography at two levels of the cortex and the subcortical white matter in patients with various types of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, C9orf72, MAPT also referred to as FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-GRN; n = 6 per syndrome) and neurologically healthy controls (NHC). Layers II-V of the cortex from diseased individuals displayed the greatest protein dysregulation as compared to NHC. Traditional biomarkers of dementia, like phosphorylated tau proteins and Aβ42 displayed dysregulation, however, our data suggest spatial enrichment distinct to cortical sublayers. In conclusion, the specific localization of these protein deposits could be used to elucidate region-specific pathologic biomarkers unique to individual variants of dementia.",NPJ dementia
39924951,A Neural Network Approach to Identify Left-Right Orientation of Anatomical Brain MRI.,"PURPOSE: This study presents a novel application of deep learning to enhance the accuracy of left-right orientation identification in anatomical brain MRI scans. Left-right orientation misidentification in brain MRIs presents significant challenges due to several factors, including metadata loss or ambiguity, which often occurs during the de-identification of medical images for research, conversion between image formats, software operations that strip or overwrite metadata, and the use of older imaging systems that stored orientation differently. METHOD: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network model was trained using 350 MRIs and evaluated on the basis of eight distinct brain MRI databases, totaling 3056 MRIs, to assess its performance across various conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. FINDING: The proposed deep-learning framework demonstrated a 99.8% accuracy in identifying the left-right orientation, thus, addressing challenges associated with the loss of orientation metadata. GradCAM was used to visualize areas of the brain where the model focused, demonstrating the importance of the right planum temporale and surrounding areas in judging left-right orientation. The planum temporale is known to exhibit notable left-right asymmetry related to language functions, underscoring the biological validity of the model. The half of the four left-right misidentified MRIs involved notable brain feature variations, such as a large arachnoidal cyst adjacent to the temporal lobe or ventricular asymmetry, indicating areas for further investigation. CONCLUSION: This approach offers a potential solution to the persistent issue of left-right misorientation in brain MRIs and supports the reliability of neuroscientific research by ensuring accurate data interpretation.",Brain and behavior
40400914,Multi-pathway blood biomarkers to target and monitor multidimensional prevention of cognitive and functional decline (nested in the IN-TeMPO study framed within the world-wide FINGERS network).,"BACKGROUND: As the population ages, the identification of preventive strategies able to delay cognitive and functional decline associated with aging represents a major challenge. To date, multidimensional approaches seem to be effective in reducing or delaying the onset of age-related diseases. OBJECTIVES: The multicentric randomized controlled trial IN-TeMPO (ItaliaN study with Tailored Multidomain interventions to Prevent functional and cognitive decline in community-dwelling Older adults, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06248723), framed within the World-Wide FINGERS network, aims to verify the efficacy of guided multidomain interventions in preventing age-related cognitive and functional decline. Within this study, we will explore a comprehensive array of established and exploratory blood biomarkers of several pathologic age-related processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegeneration, inflammation, senescence and sarcopenia, to stratify subject risk and assess the effect of multidomain interventions on biomarkers. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: ApoE4 status and plasma p-tau217 (AD), NfL (neurodegeneration), GFAP and IL-6 (inflammation), GDF-15 (senescence/sarcopenia) will be evaluated in all subjects (n = 1,662) both at the baseline and at the end of the study (12 months). Exploratory additional biomarkers will be measured at the same time points in a subgroup of 100 subjects: BDNF, ghrelin, IGF-1, irisin and redox status in plasma as markers of sarcopenia/senescence and oxidative stress, gamma-H2AX in PBMCs as marker of senescence, and amyloid beta aggregates in plasma, urine and erythrocytes as supportive markers of AD. Untargeted metabolomics analysis in plasma and untargeted volatilomics analysis in whole blood and urine will be performed to explore molecular alterations that may be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of age-related diseases in frail older adults with the aim of identifying novel potential biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The comprehensive clinical use of multiple laboratory biomarkers can contribute both to the early identification of trajectories of cognitive and functional decline in older adults, and to the identification of mechanisms underlying the effect of multidisciplinary interventions on age-related pathological processes.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39855424,Prospective memory performance and its resting-state functional connectivity correlates in individuals with memory complaints.,"This study aimed to investigate prospective memory (PM) in patients with memory complaints but without dementia (PWD) and correlate findings with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) alterations. We hypothesized that PM impairment would be evident at a certain relatively early point in the continuum and specific rsFC patterns would be the neuroimaging signature of this impairment. Sixty PWD participated in the study. The Memory Screening Test for Intentions and the Virtual Week were used to assess PM. Using the participants' PM scores as a regressor, the rsFC for PM was analyzed by Network-Based Statistics (NBS). Participants were divided into high and low PM groups (HPMG, LPMG) according to their PM scores and then their neuropsychological scores, rsFC patterns, and CSF biomarker levels were compared. The effect of education on the relationship between connectivity and CSF Aβ(42) level was examined by moderation analysis. Compared with HPMG, LPMG was impaired in both event- and time-based PM tasks, but the difference was more distinct in the event-based ones. While HPMG was more successful in event-based tasks than time-based ones, LPMG was not. As a result of NBS analysis, the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were determined as central seeds. The HPMG's performance and connectivity were higher for most comparisons but had lower CSF Aβ(42) than LPMG and therefore was closer to the positivity threshold. When the education level was at the mean and above, there was a negative correlation between CSF Aβ(42) level and overall connectivity. The connectivities of MFG, SMG, and ACC play an important role in PM performance in the PWD. In more advanced PM impairment, the impairment of spontaneous processes is more prominent. At the onset of amyloidosis, the cognitive reserve may compensate for cognitive impairment by increasing connectivity.",Neuropsychologia
39521042,Ferroptosis and cognitive impairment: Unraveling the link and potential therapeutic targets.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, share key characteristics, notably cognitive impairment and significant cell death in specific brain regions. Cognition, a complex mental process allowing individuals to perceive time and place, is disrupted in these conditions. This consistent disruption suggests the possibility of a shared underlying mechanism across all neurodegenerative diseases. One potential common factor is the activation of pathways leading to cell death. Despite significant progress in understanding cell death pathways, no definitive treatments have emerged. This has shifted focus towards less-explored mechanisms like ferroptosis, which holds potential due to its involvement in oxidative stress and iron metabolism. Unlike apoptosis or necrosis, ferroptosis offers a novel therapeutic avenue due to its distinct biochemical and genetic underpinnings, making it a promising target in neurodegenerative disease treatment. Ferroptosis is distinguished from other cellular death mechanisms, by distinctive characteristics such as an imbalance of iron hemostasis, peroxidation of lipids in the plasma membrane, and dysregulated glutathione metabolism. In this review, we discuss the potential role of ferroptosis in cognitive impairment. We then summarize the evidence linking ferroptosis biomarkers to cognitive impairment brought on by neurodegeneration while highlighting recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind the condition. Finally, we discuss the prospective therapeutic implications of targeting ferroptosis for the treatment of cognitive abnormalities associated with neurodegeneration, including natural and synthetic substances that suppress ferroptosis via a variety of mechanisms. Promising therapeutic candidates, including antioxidants and iron chelators, are being explored to inhibit ferroptosis and mitigate cognitive decline.",Neuropharmacology

29763097,Alzheimer Disease.,"Dementia is a general term used to describe a significant decline in cognitive ability that interferes with a person's activities of daily living. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of cases in individuals aged 65 and older. AD is a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset and progressive impairment of behavioral and cognitive functions. These functions include memory, comprehension, language, attention, reasoning, and judgment. While AD does not directly cause death, it substantially raises vulnerability to other complications, which can eventually lead to a person's death.  According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, AD is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2022, while COVID-19 ranked fourth. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, AD was the sixth leading cause of death following stroke.. AD typically manifests after age 65, referred to as late-onset AD (LOAD). However, early-onset AD (EOAD), occurring before 65, is less common and seen in about 5% of AD patients. EOAD often exhibits atypical symptoms, and its diagnosis is usually delayed, leading to a more aggressive disease course.  Significant progress has been made in developing biomarkers for specific and early diagnosis of AD over the past decade. These biomarkers include neuroimaging markers obtained through amyloid and tau PET scans, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma markers, such as amyloid, tau, and phospho-tau levels. There is no cure for AD, although there are treatments available that may alleviate and manage some of its symptoms. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the development of medications that aim to moderate the progression of the disease, particularly with the discovery of new disease biomarkers. The symptoms of AD can vary depending on the stage of the disease. AD is classified into different stages based on the level of cognitive impairment and disability experienced by individuals. These stages include the preclinical or presymptomatic stage, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stage. The dementia stage is further divided into mild, moderate, and severe stages (see Graph. AD Stages from Preclinical to Severe Disease). This staging system is distinct from the diagnostic criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) for AD. Episodic short-term memory loss is the initial and most common presenting symptom of typical AD. Individuals may have difficulty retaining new information while still recalling long-term memories. Individuals may experience problem-solving, judgment, executive functioning, and organizational skills impairments following short-term memory loss.  They may struggle with tasks that require multitasking and abstract thinking. In the early stages of the disease, executive functioning impairments can range from subtle to significant. Instrumental activities of daily living such as driving, financial management, cooking, and detailed activity planning are affected relatively early in their dementia. These early signs of cognitive decline are followed by language disorder and impaired visuospatial skills. Neuropsychiatric symptoms like apathy, social withdrawal, disinhibition, agitation, psychosis, and wandering are also common in the moderate to late stages. Difficulty performing learned motor tasks (dyspraxia), olfactory dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and extrapyramidal motor signs like dystonia, akathisia, and Parkinsonian symptoms occur late in the disease. Primitive reflexes, incontinence, and total dependence on caregivers follow this.",
39944741,Late-onset unexplained seizures are associated with cognitive impairment and lower amygdala volumes.,"Late-onset epilepsy has been linked with accelerated cognitive decline and a higher risk of dementia. In this study, we sought to characterize the cognitive profile of participants with late-onset unexplained epilepsy and compare their MRI findings to healthy controls, to better understand underlying disease mechanisms. We recruited participants with at least one new-onset unexplained seizure at age 55 or later, without cortical lesions on MRI, within 5 years of the first seizure. We administered a neuropsychological battery to generate Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and composite scores for delayed verbal recall, processing speed and executive function. We held a consensus meeting to determine whether the participants fulfilled criteria for mild cognitive impairment. An MRI volumetric analysis of hippocampal, amygdalae, and white matter hyperintensity volume was performed and compared to 353 healthy controls from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. On late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants, we also obtained 24-h EEG recording. Seventy participants were recruited, mean age 71.0 ± 7.0 years, 49% female, 15.6 ± 3.0 years of education. Impaired cognition (z-score ≤ -1.5) for late-onset unexplained epilepsy included the following: 15.9% for Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite -5, 23.2% for delayed verbal recall, 15.6% for processing speed and 7.5% for executive function. Seventeen percent were found to have mild cognitive impairment. Late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants who were drug resistant were more likely to have cognitive impairment (50% vs. 9%). When controlling for age, sex and race, late-onset unexplained epilepsy group had lower left AV (%; β = -0.003, P = 0.0016), right AV (%) (β = -0.003, P = 0.01), and log-transformed WMV (mm(3); β = -0.21, P = 0.03) compared with Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS); there were no differences in left or right HV between groups. EEG captured epileptiform abnormalities in 49% late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants, with a left temporal predominance (54%). In this single-site study of prospectively enrolled participants with late-onset unexplained epilepsy, we show that individuals with late-onset unexplained epilepsy exhibit cognitive impairments, mostly in verbal memory, and temporal dysfunction with left-sided predominance. Neuroimaging, when compared with healthy controls, shows lower amygdalae and white matter hyperintensity but not hippocampal volumes suggesting that the amygdalae is one of the earliest sites involved in the disease. The results also highlight the importance of seizure control given the association between mild cognitive impairment and drug-resistant epilepsy. Future studies extending these findings to Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and longitudinal follow-up will inform predictors of cognitive decline.",Brain communications

39991752,Relationship between regional relative theta power and amyloid deposition in mild cognitive impairment: an exploratory study.,"INTRODUCTION: Electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, such as increased theta power, have been proposed as biomarkers for neurocognitive disorders. Advancements in amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have enhanced our understanding of the pathology of neurocognitive disorders, such as amyloid deposition. However, much remains unknown regarding the relationship between regional amyloid deposition and EEG abnormalities. This study aimed to explore the relationship between regional EEG abnormalities and amyloid deposition in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We recruited 24 older adults with MCI from a community center for dementia prevention, and 21 participants were included in the final analysis. EEG was recorded using a 64-channel system, and amyloid deposition was measured using amyloid PET imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were used to create individualized brain models for EEG source localization. Correlations between relative theta power and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in 12 brain regions were analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations between relative theta power and SUVR values were found in several brain regions in the individualized brain model during the resting eyes-closed condition, including right temporal lobe (r = 0.581, p = 0.006), left hippocampus (r = 0.438, p = 0.047), left parietal lobe (r = 0.471, p = 0.031), right parietal lobe (r = 0.509, p = 0.018), left occipital lobe (r = 0.597, p = 0.004), and right occipital lobe (r = 0.590, p = 0.005). During the visual working memory condition, significant correlations were found in both cingulate lobes (left: r = 0.483, p = 0.027; right: r = 0.449, p = 0.041), left parietal lobe (r = 0.530, p = 0.010), right parietal lobe (r = 0.606, p = 0.004), left occipital lobe (r = 0.648, p = 0.001), and right occipital lobe (r = 0.657, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The result suggests that regional increases in relative theta power are associated with regional amyloid deposition in patients with MCI. These findings highlight the potential of EEG in detecting amyloid deposition. Future large-scale studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings and explore their clinical applications.",Frontiers in neuroscience
39834028,Single- versus two-test criteria for cognitive impairment: associations with CSF and imaging markers in former American football players.,"Objective: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), the putative clinical syndrome of chronic traumatic encephalopathy-a neuropathological disease associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI). Careful operationalization of cognitive impairment is essential to improving the diagnostic specificity and accuracy of TES criteria. We compared single- versus two-test criteria for cognitive impairment in their associations with CSF and imaging biomarkers in male former American football players. Method: 169 participants from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project completed neuropsychological tests of memory and executive functioning. Cognitive impairment was identified by single-test criteria (z≤-1.5 on one test) and two-test criteria (z<-1 on two tests within a domain). ANCOVAs adjusting for age, race, education, body mass index, word-reading score, and APOE ε4 status assessed whether single- or two-test criteria predicted CSF markers (Aβ(1-42), p-tau(181), p-tau(181)/Aβ(1-42), total tau, neurofilament light [NfL], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and MRI markers (hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensities). Results: Ninety-nine participants met single-test criteria for cognitive impairment. Sixty-six met two-test criteria. Participants who met two-test criteria had greater exposure to RHI than those who did not (p=.04). Two-test criteria were -associated with higher CSF p-tau(181)/Aβ(1-42) (q=.02) and CSF NfL (q=.02). The association between two-test criteria and CSF NfL remained after excluding amyloid-positive participants (q=.04). Single-test criteria were not associated with any biomarkers (q's>.05). Conclusions: Two-test but not single-test criteria for cognitive impairment were associated with markers of neurodegeneration. Future clinical research in TES may benefit from applying two-test criteria to operationalize cognitive impairment.",The Clinical neuropsychologist
39865747,"Dispersion-based cognitive intra-individual variability in former American football players: Association with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, repetitive head impacts, and biomarkers.","Background: Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI), such as those experienced in American football, is linked to cognitive dysfunction later in life. Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) is a proposed clinical syndrome thought to be linked to neuropath-ology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition associated with RHI from football. Cognitive intra-individual variability (d-CIIV) measures test-score dispersion, indicating cognitive dysfunction. This study examined d-CIIV in former football players and its associations with TES diagnosis, RHI exposure, and DTI and CSF biomarkers. Methods: Data included 237 males (45-74 years) from DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project, including former professional and college football players (COL) (n = 173) and asymptomatic men without RHI or TBI (n = 55). Participants completed neuropsychological tests. TES diagnosis was based on 2021 NINDS TES criteria. Years of football play and a cumulative head impact index (CHII) measured RHI exposure. Lumipulse technology was used for CSF assays. DTI fractional anisotropy assessed white matter integrity. Coefficient of variation (CoV) measured d-CIIV. ANCOVA compared d-CIIV among groups (football versus control; TES-status). Pearson correlations and linear regressions tested associations between d-CIIV, RHI exposure, and CSF and DTI biomarkers. Results: Former professional players had higher d-CIIV than controls (F(7, 194) = 2.87, p = .007). d-CIIV was associated with TES diagnosis (F(8, 146) = 9.063, p < .001), with highest d-CIIV in TES Possible/Probable-CTE. Higher d-CIIV correlated with higher CHII scores (r = 0.19), reduced CSF Aβ(1-42) (β = -0.302), increased p-tau(181) (β = 0.374), and reduced DTI FA (β = -0.202).

39758054,Aβ-reactive T cell polyfunctionality response as a new biomarker for mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves neuroinflammation and amyloid plaque deposition, yet the role of amyloid-reactive immune response in neurodegeneration remains unclear. We investigate amyloid-reactive T cell levels in the Epidemiology of Mild Cognitive Impairment Study in Taiwan (EMCIT) and Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (TPMIC) cohorts. METHOD: Using diverse amyloid peptide formulations, we established a polyfunctionality assay for five T cell functions and compared mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients to control subjects in both cohorts. RESULTS: In both cohorts, MCI individuals exhibit higher amyloid-reactive T cell responses than controls. In the TPMIC cohort, CD4+ and CD8+ total response frequencies are notably elevated in MCI (CD4: 1.3%, CD8: 1.91%) versus controls (CD4: 0.15%, CD8: 0.28%; both p < 0.001). Amyloid-reactive T cell response outperforms plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) in discriminating MCI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve CD4+: 0.97; CD8+: 0.96; p-tau181: 0.72; both p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Amyloid-reactive T cell polyfunctional response distinguishes MCI from normal aging and could serve as a novel MCI biomarker. HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid-reactive polyfunctional T cell responses can be detected in the peripheral circulation.Amyloid-reactive T cell response is significantly enhanced in individuals with mild cognitive impairment compared to age-matched, cognitively unimpaired individuals.The unique discriminative accuracy of amyloid-reactive T cell response is significantly higher than phosphorylated tau181 and is not a result of overall T cell hyperreactivity.Future studies are needed to determine the predictive role of amyloid-reactive T cell responses in disease progression and if the amyloid-reactive immune response could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39882365,"Evaluating plasma biomarkers NfL, GFAP, GDF15, and FGF21 as indicators of disease severity in Charcot-Marie Tooth patients.","BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a slowly advancing hereditary nerve disorder, presents a significant challenge in the medical field. Effective drugs for treatment are lacking, and we struggle to find sensitive markers to track the disease's severity and progression. In this study, our objective was to investigate the levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) in individuals with CMT and to compare them to a control group. Our primary goal is to determine whether these biomarker levels are related to the severity of the disease. METHODS: Initially, 44 patients with CMT and 44 controls participated in this study. CMT diagnosis was approved by genetic testing. Disease severity was assessed through clinical evaluations using the CMT Neuropathy Score version 2 (CMTNSv2). NfL and GFAP concentrations were measured using Single molecule array, while FGF-21 and GDF-15 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: In the group of patients with CMT, the concentrations of GDF15, FGF21, NfL, and GFAP were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). NfL and GFAP levels were correlated with the CMTNSv2 score (rs = 0.46, p = 0.002; rs = 0.31, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our study has provided confirmation that plasma concentrations of NfL, GFAP, GDF15, and FGF21 are significantly elevated in patients with CMT compared to controls. Furthermore, NfL and GFAP levels were correlated with the clinical severity of CMT. These findings suggest that NfL and GFAP can be reliable disease indicators in future research.",Frontiers in neurology
39845734,Brain microstructure alterations in subjective cognitive decline: a multi-component T2 relaxometry study.,"Previous research has revealed patterns of brain atrophy in subjective cognitive decline, a potential preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. However, the involvement of myelin content and microstructural alterations in subjective cognitive decline has not previously been investigated. This study included three groups of participants recruited from the Compostela Aging Study project: 53 cognitively unimpaired adults, 16 individuals with subjective cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy and 70 with subjective cognitive decline and no hippocampal atrophy. Group differences were analysed across five MRI biomarkers derived from multi-component T2 relaxometry, each sensitive to variations in cerebral composition and microstructural tissue integrity. Although no significant differences in myelin content were observed between groups, the subjective cognitive decline with hippocampal atrophy group exhibited a larger free-water fraction, and reduced fraction and relaxation times of the intra/extracellular water compartment in frontal, parietal and medial temporal lobe brain regions and white matter tracts as compared with the other groups. Moreover, both subjective cognitive decline groups displayed lower total water content as compared with the control group and the subjective cognitive decline with hippocampal atrophy group showed lower total water content as compared with the subjective cognitive decline without hippocampal atrophy group. These changes are likely related to microstructural tissue differences related to neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, iron accumulation or other physiologic variations, calling for further examinations.",Brain communications
39946839,Electrophysiological correlates of visual short-term memory binding deficits in community-dwelling seniors at risk of dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Visual Short-Term Memory Binding (VSTMB) is a preclinical marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced early event-related potentials (ERPs) (100-250 ms) over fronto-central (FC) and parieto-occipital (PO) regions have been reported in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) seen in the clinic. We investigated such ERPs in a larger sample of community-dwelling older adults who had not sought medical advice. METHODS: Participants (n = 215) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery and the VSTMB Task. The latter assessed the ability to detect changes between two consecutive arrays of shapes or colored shapes (the Binding condition). Time-locked EEG signals were collected during the task. RESULTS: Those who met the MCI criteria (n = 108) showed binding impairment. ERP analyses revealed significant Group x Time Windows interactions. Early ERP showed reduced neural recruitment (MCI < healthy controls (HC)) over the right FC regions, left PO, and right centro-parietal (CP) regions during Binding encoding, and over PO regions bilaterally and left FC during retrieval. Late ERP showed increased neural recruitment (MCI > HC) on left FC and PO regions during retrieval. CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-recruitment may reflect functional reorganization aimed at behavioral compensation in the early stages of MCI. The role of such amplitude shifts as pointers of transition points in the AD continuum needs further investigation.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of
39275911,'Knock down the brain': a nonlinear analysis of electroencephalography to study the effects of sub-concussion in boxers.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Boxing is associated with a high risk of head injuries and increases the likelihood of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This study explores the effects of sub-concussive impacts on boxers by applying both linear and nonlinear analysis methods to electroencephalogram (EEG) data. METHODS: Twenty-one boxers were selected (mean ± SD, age 28.38 ± 5.5 years; weight 67.55 ± 8.90 kg; years of activity 6.76 ± 5.45; education 14.19 ± 3.08 years) and divided into 'beginner' and 'advanced' groups. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Frontal Assessment Battery were administered; EEG data were collected in both eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions during resting states. Analyses of EEG data included normalized power spectral density (nPSD), power law exponent (PLE), detrended fluctuation analysis and multiscale entropy. Statistical analyses were used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in nPSD and PLE were observed between the beginner and advanced boxers, with advanced boxers showing decreased mean nPSD and PLE (nPSD 4-7 Hz, p = 0.013; 8-13 Hz, p = 0.003; PLE frontal lobe F3 EC, p = 0.010). Multiscale entropy analysis indicated increased entropy at lower frequencies and decreased entropy at higher frequencies in advanced boxers (F3 EC, p = 0.024; occipital lobe O1 EO, p = 0.029; occipital lobe O2 EO, p = 0.036). These changes are similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Nonlinear analysis of EEG data shows potential as a neurophysiological biomarker for detecting the asymptomatic phase of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in boxers. This methodology could help monitor athletes' health and reduce the risk of future neurological injuries in sports.",European journal of neurology
39743536,The effects of loss of Y chromosome on male health.,"Loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the most commonly occurring post-zygotic (somatic) mutation in male individuals. The past decade of research suggests that LOY has important effects in shaping the activity of the immune system, and multiple studies have shown the effects of LOY on a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease and acute infection. Epidemiological findings have been corroborated by functional analyses providing insights into the mechanisms by which LOY modulates the immune system; in particular, a causal role for LOY in cardiac fibrosis, bladder cancer and Alzheimer disease has been indicated. These insights show that LOY is a highly dynamic mutation (such that LOY clones expand and contract with time) and has pleiotropic, cell-type-specific effects. Here, we review the status of the field and highlight the potential of LOY as a biomarker and target of new therapeutics that aim to counteract its negative effects on the immune system.",Nature reviews.

39864923,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, orexin, and sleep-wake cycle: The link with the neurodegeneration.","Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) significantly affects the sleep-wake circadian rhythm through intermittent hypoxia and chronic sleep fragmentation. OSAS patients often experience excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent awakenings, and sleep fragmentation, leading to a disrupted circadian rhythm and altered sleep-wake cycle. These disruptions may exacerbate OSAS symptoms and contribute to neurodegenerative processes, particularly through the modulation of clock gene expression such as CLOCK, BMAL1, and PER. Emerging evidence connects OSAS to cognitive impairment and suggests that these changes may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, suggesting that OSAS could be a reversible risk factor for these conditions. Biomarkers, including melatonin and orexin, play crucial roles in understanding these mechanisms. In OSAS patients, melatonin, a marker of circadian rhythmicity, often shows altered secretion patterns that are not fully corrected by continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Orexin, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle, exhibits increased cerebrospinal fluid levels in OSAS patients, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms against sleep impairment and daytime sleepiness. These biomarkers highlight the intricate relationship between circadian rhythm disruptions and neurodegenerative risks in OSAS, emphasizing the need for further research and potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate these effects and improve patient outcomes.",Handbook of clinical neurology
39884114,Circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 and the risk of multiple sclerosis: a prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is positively associated with the risks of certain neurological disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. However, the association of IGF-1 with the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 348,324 participants at baseline were included from the UK biobank in this prospective study. The association of circulating IGF-1 level with MS was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard models. Further, subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the variables influencing these associations. RESULTS: Among 348,324 individuals, lower circulating IGF-1 concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of MS (95 % CI, 0.5930-0.9700; P value = 0.02763). The association between lower IGF-1 levels and reduced risk of MS remains robust in older and female participants. Moreover, risk of MS appeared to be lower in IGF-1-low individuals who never smoked, currently drinking alcohol, with higher body mass index, and higher glucose concentrations. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a lower concentration of serum IGF-1 was associated with a reduced risk of MS. The results provide evidence that the circulating IGF-1 may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MS.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders
39911246,Serum NFL and neuropsychological performance over ∼8 years in women with and without HIV: a longitudinal repeated measures study.,"BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke, including serum neurofilament light chain (sNFL), are understudied in women living with and without HIV. METHODS: We assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal change in sNFL between 2008 and 2019 associated with neuropsychological performance (NP) among women living with HIV (WLWH) and without HIV (WLWOH) age ≥40 years in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Baseline and repeated ∼8-year fasting sNFL levels were measured using Simoa. Sociodemographically-adjusted NP T-scores (attention, working memory, executive function, processing speed, learning, verbal fluency and global) were calculated. Multivariable linear regression analyses stratified by HIV serostatus examined cross-sectional baseline and follow-up associations, and ∼8-year change in sNFL level related to global and domain-specific NP T-scores. FINDINGS: 417 participants (290 WLWH, 127 WLWOH), African American/Black (55%), ≥high school education (69%), current/former smokers (79%), and overweight/obese (BMI ≥25.0 kg/m(2), 74%) were included. Compared to WLWOH at baseline, WLWH performed worse on memory and global NP. WLWH versus WLWOH had higher baseline (p ≤ 0.001) and follow-up median (p < 0.0001) sNFL levels and ∼8-year change (46.5% in WLWH versus 24.4% in WLWOH, p < 0.0001). Among WLWH, higher baseline sNFL was associated with poorer processing speed, learning, memory and verbal fluency. Among WLWOH, higher baseline sNFL was associated with poorer executive function, processing speed and verbal fluency. Among WLWH, higher follow-up sNFL was associated with poorer executive function. Among WLWOH, higher follow-up sNFL was associated with poorer executive function, processing speed, attention, memory, and global NP. ∼8-year increase in sNFL occurred in both WLWH and WLWOH and was associated with poorer executive function, processing speed, memory, and global performance at follow-up among WLWOH, and poorer executive function in WLWH. Adjustment for multiple comparisons showed associations at cross-sectional follow-up and ∼8-year increase in sNFL in WLWOH, only. Higher sNFL was associated with poorer baseline processing speed in WLWH only. INTERPRETATION: Higher levels and greater ∼8-year increases in sNFL were associated with poorer NP by domain in WLWH and WLWOH differentially over time.

39827936,Mapping the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome in Bipolar Disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric condition with unclear etiology and no established biomarkers. Here, we aimed to characterize the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome in euthymic individuals with BD to identify potential protein biomarkers. METHODS: We used nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify over 2000 CSF proteins in 374 individuals from two independent clinical cohorts (n = 164 cases + 89 controls and 66 cases + 55 controls, respectively). A subset of the cases was followed longitudinally and reexamined after a median of 6.5 years. RESULTS: Differential abundance analysis revealed 41 proteins with robust case-control association in both cohorts. These included lower levels of synaptic proteins (e.g., APP, CLSTN1, NPTX2, NRXN1) and axon guidance and cell adhesion molecules (e.g., NEO1, NCAM1, SEMA7A) and higher levels of blood-brain barrier integrity proteins (e.g., VTN, SERPIN3) and complement components (e.g., C1RL, C3, C5). The findings were consistently driven by the BD type 1 subtype. Comparing BD type 1 participants with control participants increased discoverability, revealing 86 replicated associations despite a loss of statistical power. Moreover, longitudinal analyses of coexpression modules revealed dynamic changes in the CSF proteome composition that correlated with clinical outcomes, including disease severity, future manic episodes, and symptom improvement. Finally, we conducted association analyses of CSF proteins with genetic risk loci for BD and schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first large-scale untargeted profiling of the CSF proteome in BD, unveiling potential biomarkers and providing in vivo support for altered synaptic and brain connectivity processes, impaired neurovascular integrity, and complement activation in the pathology of BD.",Biological psychiatry
40114925,"Ambroxol attenuates detrimental effect of LPS-induced glia-mediated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive dysfunction in mice brain.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are multifactorial. Among various factors, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, are considered potential causative agents. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still no cure. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of ambroxol against LPS-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and the associated cognitive dysfunction. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS (250 µg/kg every alternative day for a total of seven doses over 14 days) triggered glial cell activation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration in the mouse brain. Ambroxol treatment (30 mg/kg/day for 14 days) significantly reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress compared to LPS-treated mice. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence results showed that ambroxol reduced levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and oxidative stress kinase phospho-c-Jun N-terminal Kinase 1 (p-JNK). It also decreased astrocyte and microglia activation in the cortex and hippocampus of LPS+ Amb-treated mice, as indicated by the downregulation of GFAP and Iba-1. Furthermore, ambroxol-reversed LPS-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β and TNF-α, through regulation of the transcription factor p-NFkB. Persistent neuroinflammation disrupted the natural antioxidant mechanisms, leading to oxidative stress. Ambroxol treatment upregulated antioxidant markers, including Nrf-2, HO-1, and SOD, which were downregulated in the LPS-treated group. Additionally, ambroxol-inhibited lipid peroxidation, maintaining malondialdehyde levels in the mouse brain. Ambroxol also improves synaptic integrity by upregulating synaptic biomarkers, including PSD-95 and SNAP-23. Overall, ambroxol demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects in LPS-treated mice, highlighting its potential benefits in neurological disorders.",Frontiers in immunology
39975470,Characterization of plasma AT(N) biomarkers among a racial and ethnically diverse community-based cohort: an HABS-HD study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers of Amyloid(A), Tau(T), and Neurodegeneration(N) have been increasingly studied to fill the gap in our understanding of racial and ethnic differences. This study aimed to examine the relationship between plasma AT(N) biomarkers and (1) AT(N) neuroimaging biomarkers, (2) demographics, (3) medical comorbidities, and (4) cognitive diagnosis. METHODS: Data were analyzed from n = 764 non-Hispanic Black (NHB), n = 1230 Hispanic, and n = 1232 non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants. Plasma AT(N) biomarkers were derived using single molecule array (SIMOA) technology on an HD-X imager and included amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40, total tau, ptau181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Clinical reads of positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau positivity were used to examine the link between AT(N) plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers. Generalized linear models were conducted to examine the relationship between plasma AT(N) biomarkers and select demographic, diagnostic, and medical comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease). RESULTS: Differences in the AT(N) biomarkers were found across racial/ethnic groups. Plasma Aβ42/40 was found to be associated with PET amyloid positivity only among NHW participants, while plasma NfL was found to correlate with Meta-ROI among NHB and Hispanic participants. Ptau181 was associated with PET amyloid positivity among NHB and NHW participants and well as PET tau positivity among the latter group and Hispanic participants. Diabetes was related to increased plasma AT(N) biomarkers among NHB and Hispanic participants. CKD was associated with increased AT(N) biomarkers for all race/ethnic groups with the exception of Aβ42/40. While Aβ42/40, total tau, ptau181, and NfL were found to be related to a dementia diagnosis among NHW participants, only ptau181 and NfL were found to be related to this same diagnostic category among NHB and Hispanic participants. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate differential relationships between comorbidities (demographic, medical, diagnostic) across NHB, Hispanic, and NHW participants. This work expands our knowledge regarding the associations of plasma biomarkers to AD pathology in diverse populations. HIGHLIGHTS: Differences in AT(N) plasma biomarkers were found in a diverse community cohort.While plasma Aβ42/40 was associated with PET amyloid positivity among non-Hispanic white participants, this did not apply to non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic participants.Medical comorbidity of diabetes and chronic kidney disease was related to increased plasma AT(N) biomarkers among the ethnically diverse segment of the cohort.Plasma AT(N) biomarkers were more so related to a diagnosis of dementia for non-Hispanic white as compared to Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black participants.Across racial/ethnic groups, the plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration (NfL) and ptau181 were related to a diagnosis of dementia.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

39804693,Clinical Decision Support Using Speech Signal Analysis: Systematic Scoping Review of Neurological Disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Digital biomarkers are increasingly used in clinical decision support for various health conditions. Speech features as digital biomarkers can offer insights into underlying physiological processes due to the complexity of speech production. This process involves respiration, phonation, articulation, and resonance, all of which rely on specific motor systems for the preparation and execution of speech. Deficits in any of these systems can cause changes in speech signal patterns. Increasing efforts are being made to develop speech-based clinical decision support systems. OBJECTIVE: This systematic scoping review investigated the technological revolution and recent digital clinical speech signal analysis trends to understand the key concepts and research processes from clinical and technical perspectives. METHODS: A systematic scoping review was undertaken in 6 databases guided by a set of research questions. Articles that focused on speech signal analysis for clinical decision-making were identified, and the included studies were analyzed quantitatively. A narrower scope of studies investigating neurological diseases were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 389 articles met the initial eligibility criteria, of which 72 (18.5%) that focused on neurological diseases were included in the qualitative analysis. In the included studies, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and cognitive disorders were the most frequently investigated conditions. The literature explored the potential of speech feature analysis in diagnosis, differentiating between, assessing the severity and monitoring the treatment of neurological conditions. The common speech tasks used were sustained phonations, diadochokinetic tasks, reading tasks, activity-based tasks, picture descriptions, and prompted speech tasks. From these tasks, conventional speech features (such as fundamental frequency, jitter, and shimmer), advanced digital signal processing-based speech features (such as wavelet transformation-based features), and spectrograms in the form of audio images were analyzed. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches were used to build predictive models, whereas statistical analysis assessed variable relationships and reliability of speech features. Model evaluations primarily focused on analytical validations. A significant research gap was identified: the need for a structured research process to guide studies toward potential technological intervention in clinical settings. To address this, a research framework was proposed that adapts a design science research methodology to guide research studies systematically. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight how data science techniques can enhance speech signal analysis to support clinical decision-making. By combining knowledge from clinical practice, speech science, and data science within a structured research framework, future research may achieve greater clinical relevance.",Journal of medical Internet research
39886532,AI-driven multi-omics integration for multi-scale predictive modeling of genotype-environment-phenotype relationships.,"Despite the wealth of single-cell multi-omics data, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of novel genetic and chemical perturbations in the human body. It requires knowledge of molecular interactions at all biological levels, encompassing disease models and humans. Current machine learning methods primarily establish statistical correlations between genotypes and phenotypes but struggle to identify physiologically significant causal factors, limiting their predictive power. Key challenges in predictive modeling include scarcity of labeled data, generalization across different domains, and disentangling causation from correlation. In light of recent advances in multi-omics data integration, we propose a new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered biology-inspired multi-scale modeling framework to tackle these issues. This framework will integrate multi-omics data across biological levels, organism hierarchies, and species to predict genotype-environment-phenotype relationships under various conditions. AI models inspired by biology may identify novel molecular targets, biomarkers, pharmaceutical agents, and personalized medicines for presently unmet medical needs.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal
40092071,Serum-derived exosomal microRNAs as biomarkers for postoperative delirium.,"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent and challenging complication in elderly surgical patients, marked by abrupt cognitive and attentional disturbances. Current POD diagnosis depends on clinical assessments that are time-intensive and lack predictive accuracy before surgery. Although previous research has explored biomarkers such as neuroinflammatory factors and Alzheimer's-related proteins to enhance POD prediction, single molecular markers have proven insufficient for reliable prognosis. METHODS: This study investigated serum exosomal miRNA expression profiles in postoperative patients to assess their association with POD. We compared miRNA expression between POD and non-POD groups through cognitive assessments and serum analyses. Additionally, enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the biological pathways regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 57 miRNAs with significantly altered expression between POD and non-POD patients, including 16 upregulated and 41 downregulated miRNAs in the POD group. Enrichment analysis revealed that these miRNAs are involved in genes regulating neurotrophin signaling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, and pathways that influence neuronal plasticity and cell viability. DISCUSSION: This study highlights specific miRNAs as potential biomarkers for POD and suggests their involvement in the underlying mechanisms of cognitive decline following surgery. By enhancing diagnostic capabilities and identifying potential therapeutic targets, our findings could lead to more effective POD management strategies for elderly patients. Further research is recommended to validate these miRNAs and evaluate their clinical utility for predictive screening and therapeutic interventions.",Frontiers in neuroscience
39368279,DeepResBat: Deep residual batch harmonization accounting for covariate distribution differences.,"Pooling MRI data from multiple datasets requires harmonization to reduce undesired inter-site variabilities, while preserving effects of biological variables (or covariates). The popular harmonization approach ComBat uses a mixed effect regression framework that explicitly accounts for covariate distribution differences across datasets. There is also significant interest in developing harmonization approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs), such as conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). However, current DNN approaches do not explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets. Here, we provide mathematical results, suggesting that not accounting for covariates can lead to suboptimal harmonization. We propose two DNN-based covariate-aware harmonization approaches: covariate VAE (coVAE) and DeepResBat. The coVAE approach is a natural extension of cVAE by concatenating covariates and site information with site- and covariate-invariant latent representations. DeepResBat adopts a residual framework inspired by ComBat. DeepResBat first removes the effects of covariates with nonlinear regression trees, followed by eliminating site differences with cVAE. Finally, covariate effects are added back to the harmonized residuals. Using three datasets from three continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10,085 anatomical T1 scans, we find that DeepResBat and coVAE outperformed ComBat, CovBat and cVAE in terms of removing dataset differences, while enhancing biological effects of interest. However, coVAE hallucinates spurious associations between anatomical MRI and covariates even when no association exists. Future studies proposing DNN-based harmonization approaches should be aware of this false positive pitfall. Overall, our results suggest that DeepResBat is an effective deep learning alternative to ComBat. Code for DeepResBat can be found here: https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/harmonization/An2024_DeepResBat.",Medical image analysis
40421034,Association of serum 25(OH)D3 and cognitive levels with biological aging in the elderly: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Biological aging, a fundamental process affecting health and longevity, is pivotal to understanding the physiological decline associated with aging. Serum vitamin D3 deficiency and cognitive impairment are common health issues among older adults. However, the joint associations of serum vitamin D levels and cognitive impairment with biological aging remain poorly understood. This study aims to evaluate the independent and combined associations of serum vitamin D3 and cognitive impairment with biological aging in older adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included adults aged 60 years and older from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Biological aging was measured using Phenotypic Age calculated from biomarkers. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Centre for the Establishment of a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, the Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). Multivariable regression and restricted cubic spline models were used to examine the relationships between serum 25(OH)D3 levels, cognitive performance, and biological aging. RESULTS: After adjusting for all covariates, individuals in the highest quartile of cognitive performance had a reduced risk of biological aging compared to those in the lowest quartile (CERAD: OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.57-1.46; AFT: OR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-0.82; DSST: OR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77). A U-shaped relationship was observed between serum 25(OH)D3 levels and biological aging. Combined analyses revealed that individuals with both low serum 25(OH)D3 and low cognitive performance had the highest risk of biological aging across all cognitive tests (CERAD: OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-1.98; AFT: OR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.24-2.32; DSST: OR 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.27). Notably, in the DSST, individuals with normal serum 25(OH)D3 levels and normal cognitive performance showed a reduction in Phenotypic Age by 2.40 years (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In older adults, low serum 25(OH)D3 levels combined with low cognitive performance are strongly associated with an increased risk of biological aging.",Frontiers in nutrition
40568416,Self- versus caregiver-reported apathy across neurological disorders.,"Apathy is a prevalent and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome across many neurological disorders, significantly impacting both patients and caregivers. We systematically quantified discrepancies between self- and caregiver-reported apathy in 335 patients with a variety of diagnoses, such as frontotemporal dementia (behavioural variant and semantic dementia subtypes), Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's disease dementia, mild cognitive impairment, small vessel cerebrovascular disease, subjective cognitive decline and autoimmune encephalitis. Using the Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) and its analogous caregiver version (AMI-CG), we found that caregiver-reported apathy consistently exceeded self-reported levels across all conditions. Moreover, self-reported apathy accounted for only 14.1% of the variance in caregiver ratings. This apathy reporting discrepancy was most pronounced in conditions associated with impaired insight, such as behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and was significantly correlated with cognitive impairment. Deficits in memory and fluency explained an additional 11.2% of the variance in caregiver-reported apathy. Specifically, executive function deficits (e.g. indexed by fluency) and memory impairments may contribute to behavioural inertia or recall of it. These findings highlight the need to integrate patient and caregiver perspectives in apathy assessments, especially for conditions with prominent cognitive impairment. To improve diagnostic accuracy and deepen our understanding of apathy across neurological disorders, we highlight the need for adapted apathy assessment strategies that account for cognitive impairment particularly in individuals with insight or memory deficits. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underpinning discordant apathy reporting in dementia might help inform targeted clinical interventions and reduce caregiver burden.",Brain communications
39843911,Microglia modulate the cerebrovascular reactivity through ectonucleotidase CD39.,"Microglia and the border-associated macrophages contribute to the modulation of cerebral blood flow, but the mechanisms have remained uncertain. Here, we show that microglia regulate the cerebral blood flow baseline and the responses to whisker stimulation or intra-cisternal magna injection of adenosine triphosphate, but not intra-cisternal magna injection of adenosine in mice model. Notably, microglia repopulation corrects these cerebral blood flow anomalies. The microglial-dependent regulation of cerebral blood flow requires the adenosine triphosphate-sensing P2RY12 receptor and ectonucleotidase CD39 that initiates the dephosphorylation of extracellular adenosine triphosphate into adenosine in both male and female mice. Pharmacological inhibition or CX3CR1-CreER-mediated deletion of CD39 mimics the cerebral blood flow anomalies in microglia-deficient mice and reduces the upsurges of extracellular adenosine following whisker stimulation. Together, these results suggest that the microglial CD39-initiated breakdown of extracellular adenosine triphosphate co-transmitter is an important step in neurovascular coupling and the regulation of cerebrovascular reactivity.",Nature communications
39830255,Predilection for Perplexion: Preoperative microstructural damage is linked to postoperative delirium.,"Postoperative delirium is the most common postsurgical complication in older adults and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). However, the neurological basis of this increased risk-whether postoperative delirium unmasks latent preoperative pathology or leads to AD-relevant pathology after perioperative brain injury-remains unclear. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques now enable the detection of subtle brain features or damage that may underlie clinical symptoms. Among these, Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) can help identify microstructural brain damage, even in the absence of visible macro-anatomical abnormalities. To investigate potential brain microstructural abnormalities associated with postoperative delirium and cognitive function, we analyzed pre- and post-operative diffusion MRI data from 111 patients aged ≥60 years who underwent non-cardiac/non-intracranial surgery. Specifically, we investigated preoperative variation in diffusion metrics within the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region in which prior work has identified glucose metabolism alterations in the delirious brain, and a key region in the early accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in preclinical AD. We also examined the relationship of preoperative PCC NODDI abnormalities with preoperative cognitive function. Compared to patients who did not develop postoperative delirium (n=99), we found increased free water (FISO) and neurite density index (NDI) and decreased orientation dispersion index (ODI) in the dorsal PCC before surgery among those who later developed postoperative delirium (n=12). These FISO differences before surgery remained present at six weeks postoperatively, while these NDI and ODI differences did not. Preoperative dorsal PCC NDI and ODI values were also positively associated with preoperative attention/concentration performance, independent of age, education level, and global brain atrophy. Yet, these diffusion metrics were not correlated with cerebrospinal fluid Aβ positivity or levels. These results suggest that preoperative latent brain abnormalities within the dorsal PCC may underlie susceptibility to postoperative delirium, independent of AD-related (i.e., Aβ) neuropathology. Furthermore, these preoperative microstructural differences in the dorsal PCC were linked to preoperative deficits in attention/concentration, a core feature of postoperative delirium. Our findings highlight microstructural vulnerability within the PCC, a key region of the default mode network, as a neuroanatomic locus that can help explain the link between preoperative attention/concentration deficits and increased postoperative delirium risk among vulnerable older surgical patients.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
39373063,Associations of age and sex with characteristics of extracellular vesicles and protein-enriched fractions of blood plasma.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized particles that are released by various cell types and play vital roles in intercellular communication. They carry biological molecules reflecting the physiological and pathological states of their source cells and tissues, showing potential as biomarkers. However, the impact of demographic factors like age and sex on the properties of blood plasma EVs remains underexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating how these factors influence the particle count and proteomic profiles of plasma EV preparations and corresponding protein fractions. Plasma samples from 120 healthy volunteers were collected and pooled into six groups: young males (age: 27.6 ± 4.0), young females (27.4 ± 3.8), middle-aged males (48.8 ± 3.8), middle-aged females (48.9 ± 3.9), old males (69.3 ± 3.9), and old females (69.4 ± 4.3). EV- and protein-enriched fractions were separated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fractions were characterized for particle number concentration and protein composition to identify characteristics affected by age and biological sex. Plasma EVs and corresponding protein fractions exhibited distinct characteristics, with differential enrichment of markers related to EVs and other blood components, including lipoproteins. Proteomic profiles of both EVs and protein fractions displayed sex- and age-dependent differences. Differentially abundant proteins displayed functions previously identified in the context of aging and sex differences, highlighting their utility as biomarkers. Age and sex significantly affect the characteristics of plasma EVs and proteins, potentially influencing their efficacy and interpretation as biomarkers in clinical applications. This study lays the groundwork for detailed mechanistic research to understand how EVs mediate age- and sex-related effects in health.",Aging cell

40260083,Association between retinal layer thickness and postoperative delirium in older patients.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications in the older surgical population, but its pathogenesis and biomarkers are largely undetermined. Retinal layer thickness has been demonstrated to be associated with cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, relatively little is known about possible retinal layer thickness among patients with postoperative delirium. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the relationship between retinal layer thickness and postoperative delirium in this cross-sectional study. METHODS: The participants (≥65 years old) having elective surgery under general anaesthesia were screened via medical records from Shanghai 10th People's Hospital. Preoperative macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness were measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) algorithm and CAM-Severity (CAM-S) were used to assess the incidence and severity of postoperative delirium on the first, second and third days after surgery. RESULTS: Among 169 participants (mean (standard deviation (SD) 71.15 (4.36) years), 40 (24%) developed postoperative delirium. Notably, individuals who developed postoperative delirium exhibited thicker preoperative macular thickness in the right eye compared with those who did not (mean (SD) 283.35 (27.97) µm vs 273.84 (20.14) µm, p=0.013). Furthermore, the thicker preoperative macular thickness of the right eye was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio 1.593, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.093 to 2.322, p=0.015) and greater severity (adjusted mean difference (β)=0.256, 95% CI 0.037 to 0.476, p=0.022) after adjustment for age, sex and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. However, such a difference or association did not appear in the left macular or bilateral peripapillary RNFL thicknesses. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings demonstrated that preoperative macular thickness might serve as a potential non-invasive marker for the vulnerability of developing postoperative delirium in older surgical patients. Further large-scale validation studies should be performed to confirm these results.",General psychiatry

Apart from its role in plants, MJ has garnered significant attention because of its pharmacological effects and possible therapeutic use in human health. This thorough analysis looks into the many biological actions of MJ, such as its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. The underlying mechanism of these actions is examined, emphasizing MJ's ability to modulate important signaling pathways, cause cancer cells to undergo apoptosis, and boost immunological responses. Furthermore, MJ's capacity to manage long-term illnesses like cancer and neurological conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's is examined. Preclinical and clinical research are beginning to provide evidence that MJ may be a useful medicinal drug. Nevertheless, more research is needed to fully understand its mode of action, enhance its administration methods, and evaluate its efficacy and safety in humans. This review highlights MJ's therapeutic promise and supports earlier research into its pharmacological capabilities and possible medical applications. This abstract highlights methyl jasmonate's pharmacological effects and therapeutic potential by providing a concise overview of the main topics covered in a thorough review.",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology
39875529,"Cognitive reserve is associated with education, social determinants, and cognitive outcomes among older American Indians in the Strong Heart Study.","Cognitive reserve, a component of resilience, may be conceptualized as the ability to overcome accumulating neuropathology and maintain healthy aging and function. However, research measuring and evaluating it in American Indians is needed. We recruited American Indians from 3 regional centers for longitudinal examinations (2010-13, n = 818; 2017-19, n = 403) including MRI, cognitive, clinical, and questionnaire data. We defined cognitive reserve by measuring the residual from individual regressions of cognitive tests over imaged brain volumes, adjusted for age and sex. Analyses examined three different metrics of cognitive reserve against sociodemographic, clinical, and longitudinal cognitive data in causal mediation models. Better cognitive reserve was significantly associated with more education, higher income, lower prevalence of depression, lower prevalence of diabetes, and lower prevalence of kidney disease, but we found no statistically significant evidence for an association with plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, APOE e4 carrier status, alcohol use, body mass, or hypertension. Better cognitive reserve was associated with better cognitive function over mean 6.7 years follow-up (range 4-9 years); and the association for education with cognition over time was mediated in part (15-24%) by cognitive reserve. Cognitive reserve, although challenging to measure, appears important for understanding the range of cognitive aging in American Indians.",Communications psychology
39670317,Baroreflex Sensitivity and Long-Term Dementia Risk in Older Adults.,"BACKGROUND: Increased blood pressure (BP) variability is linked to dementia risk, but the relationship between baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), a fundamental mechanism for maintaining stable BP, and dementia risk is undetermined. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that impaired BRS is associated with increased dementia risk in 1819 older adults (63% women; age, 71.0±6.3 years) from the community-based Rotterdam Study. Cardiac BRS was determined from a 5-minute beat-to-beat BP recording at supine rest between 1997 and 1999. Cardiac BRS measures the correlation between changes in consecutive beat-to-beat systolic BP and subsequent responses in heartbeat intervals, with a higher value indicating better BRS. The primary outcome was incident dementia ascertained from baseline through January 1, 2020; the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 14.8 years, 421 participants developed dementia. The association of cardiac BRS with dementia risk differed by antihypertensive medication use (P(interaction)=0.03) and was only observed in participants not taking antihypertensives. Specifically, in those not taking antihypertensive medication, reduced BRS was associated with a higher risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio comparing bottom versus top quintiles, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.07-2.40]; P(trend)=0.02). Reduced BRS was also associated with an increased risk of death (corresponding hazard ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.32-2.35]). The association remained after adjusting for average BP and BP variability. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired BRS partly explains hypertension-related brain damage and excessive dementia risk beyond conventional BP measures, making it a potential novel biomarker for the early detection and prevention of dementia.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)"
40114782,Higher plasma neurofilament-light chain concentration in drug-resistant epilepsy.,"Drug-resistant epilepsy is the most severe form of epilepsy and is frequently associated with cognitive decline. Whether drug-resistant epilepsy results in neurodegeneration or other types of brain injury is not known, and early detection of detrimental clinical trajectories would be clinically very useful. Blood biomarkers of brain injury reflect neurodegeneration or brain injury in several brain diseases but have not been extensively studied in epilepsy. We investigated a panel of such markers in a large epilepsy cohort with an emphasis on assessing differences between drug-resistant and monotherapy-controlled epilepsy. Blood neurofilament light, glial fibrillary acidic protein, total tau, S100 calcium-binding protein B and neuron-specific enolase concentrations were measured in 444 patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with epilepsy participating in a prospective regional Biobank study in Västra Götaland (Sweden). Multiple linear regression assessed associations between clinical variables and marker levels. Levels were then compared between patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (n = 101) and patients with monotherapy-controlled epilepsy (n = 164). We also performed logistic regression analysis to evaluate the significance of the markers as predictors of epilepsy status (drug-resistant epilepsy or monotherapy-controlled epilepsy) while controlling for clinical variables: age, sex, epilepsy duration, epilepsy type and lesions. All markers correlated with age. In younger patients (≤50 years), cases of drug-resistant epilepsy had higher levels of neurofilament light (P = 0.002) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (P = 0.006) compared with monotherapy-controlled epilepsy. After excluding patients with known structural lesions, neurofilament light levels remained significantly elevated in drug-resistant epilepsy versus monotherapy-controlled epilepsy (P = 0.029). Neurofilament light also emerged as a significant predictor of drug-resistant status in a logistic regression model following adjustments for clinical variables. Future studies should explore if neurofilament light can be used for surveillance of disease course and whether it reflects brain injury in drug-resistant epilepsy.",Brain communications
39849490,Single-cell RNA sequencing highlights the role of distinct natural killer subsets in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation plays a major role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and cumulative evidence suggests that systemic inflammation and the infiltration of immune cells into the brain contribute to this process. However, no study has investigated the role of peripheral blood immune cells in ALS pathophysiology using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). METHODS: We aimed to characterize immune cells from blood and identify ALS-related immune alterations at single-cell resolution. For this purpose, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 14 ALS patients and 14 cognitively unimpaired healthy individuals (HC), matched by age and gender, and cryopreserved until library preparation and scRNAseq. We analyzed differences in the proportions of PBMC, gene expression, and cell-cell communication patterns between ALS patients and HC, as well as their association with plasma neurofilament light (NfL) concentrations, a surrogate biomarker for neurodegeneration. Flow cytometry was used to validate alterations in cell type proportions. RESULTS: We identified the expansion of CD56(dim) natural killer (NK) cells in ALS (fold change = 2; adj. p-value = 0.0051), mainly driven by a specific subpopulation, NK_2 cells (fold change = 3.12; adj. p-value = 0.0001), which represent a mature and cytotoxic CD56(dim) NK subset. Our results revealed extensive gene expression alterations in NK_2 cells, pointing towards the activation of immune response (adj. p-value = 9.2 × 10(- 11)) and the regulation of lymphocyte proliferation (adj. p-value = 6.46 × 10(- 6)). We also identified gene expression changes in other immune cells, such as classical monocytes, and distinct CD8 + effector memory T cells which suggested enhanced antigen presentation via major histocompatibility class-II (adj. p-value = 1.23 × 10(- 8)) in ALS. The inference of cell-cell communication patterns demonstrated that the interaction between HLA-E and CD94:NKG2C from different lymphocytes to NK_2 cells is unique to ALS blood compared to HC. Finally, regression analysis revealed that the proportion of CD56(bright) NK cells along with the ALSFRS-r, disease duration, and gender, explained up to 76.4% of the variance in plasma NfL levels. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal a signature of relevant changes occurring in peripheral blood immune cells in ALS and underscore alterations in the proportion, gene expression, and signaling patterns of a cytotoxic and terminally differentiated CD56(dim) NK subpopulation (NK_2), as well as a possible role of CD56(bright) NK cells in neurodegeneration.",Journal of neuroinflammation
39745618,Resistance training protects the hippocampus and precuneus against atrophy and benefits white matter integrity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cognitive alterations with preservation of functionality. Individuals with this diagnosis have a higher risk of developing dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, are beneficial for the cognition of this population. However, the impact of resistance training (RT) on the brain anatomy of older adults with MCI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effects of RT on cognition and brain anatomy in MCI. Forty-four older adults with MCI, 22 in the training group and 22 in the control group, were evaluated in neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging at the beginning and end of the study, which lasted 24 weeks. We used repeated measures ANOVA. The training group showed better performance in verbal episodic memory after intervention. The control group showed a decrease in gray matter volume in the hippocampus and precuneus, while the training group showed no reduction in the right hippocampus and precuneus. However, it showed a decrease in the volume of these regions on the left side and in the left superior frontal gyrus. In the analysis of white matter integrity, fractional anisotropy increased in the training group and decreased in the control group. Axial diffusivity decreased in the training group, while radial diffusivity increased in the control group, and mean diffusivity varied according to the tract evaluated. RT improves memory performance, positively influences white matter integrity parameters, and plays a protective role against atrophy of the hippocampus and precuneus in MCI.",GeroScience
40462862,Ion concentrations in CSF and serum are differentially and precisely regulated.,"Fluctuations of extracellular brain ion concentrations have been associated with transitions between brain states such as sleep and wakefulness, and disturbances have been implicated in a variety of neurological conditions, including dementia, epilepsy and migraine. This study aims to define the normal CSF ion profile and identify key factors influencing its regulation. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed samples from 42 individuals (16 men), including 28 healthy participants and 14 patients with medically unexplained neurological symptoms. Age spanned between 20 and 55 years. Using validated clinical assays, we measured paired CSF and serum concentrations of Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺, Mg²⁺ and Na⁺. We examined their interrelationships and assessed the impact of blood-brain barrier permeability (the albumin quotient), age, sampling time and sex. CSF ion concentrations were highly stable and maintained within distinct, narrow ranges, separate from serum ranges for all ions measured (P < 0.0001), with no overlapping. Cl(-) (+25%), Na(+) (+5%) and Mg(2+) (+37%) concentrations were higher, while K(+) (-30%) and Ca(2+) (-50%) concentrations were lower. Consistent with an independent and active CNS homeostatic control, CSF concentrations of K(+), Cl(-) or Mg(2+) showed no significant correlation with their serum counterparts, while Na(+) and Ca(2+) displayed moderate associations with serum levels. Moreover, blood-brain barrier permeability had no significant impact on CSF ion concentrations. Small, but significant, age-related declines were observed for Cl(-), Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) in CSF, and circadian fluctuations affected K(+), which increased slightly in the afternoon. Minor sex differences were noted, with men exhibiting slightly higher Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) levels. Our findings demonstrate that CSF ion concentrations are precisely regulated at the barriers of the CNS, largely independent of serum levels and with low interindividual variation, reinforcing the concept of a highly controlled CNS environment. This distinct ion composition may help modulate neuronal excitability, supporting brain state transitions such as sleep-wake cycling. Identification of hydration status as a potential confounding factor suggests that normalization to CSF-Na(+) may improve the detection of pathological disruptions in CSF ion homeostasis. These insights reinforce the foundation for using CSF ion profiles as biomarkers for neurological disorders.",Brain communications
39804509,Automated characterisation of cerebral microbleeds using their size and spatial distribution on brain MRI.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small, hypointense hemosiderin deposits in the brain measuring 2-10 mm in diameter. As one of the important biomarkers of small vessel disease, they have been associated with various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Hence, automated detection, and subsequent extraction of clinically useful metrics (e.g., size and spatial distribution) from CMBs are essential for investigating their clinical impact, especially in large-scale studies. While some work has been done for CMB segmentation, extraction of clinically relevant information is not yet explored. Herein, we propose the first automated method to characterise CMBs using their size and spatial distribution, i.e., CMB count in three regions (and their substructures) used in Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale (MARS): infratentorial, deep, and lobar. Our method uses structural atlases of the brain for determining individual regions. On an intracerebral haemorrhage study dataset, we achieved a mean absolute error of 2.5 mm for size estimation and an overall accuracy > 90% for automated rating. The code and the atlas of MARS regions in Montreal Neurological Institute-MNI space are publicly available. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our method to automatically characterise cerebral microbleeds (size and location) showed a mean absolute error of 2.5 mm for size estimation and an over 90% accuracy for rating of infratentorial, deep and lobar regions. This is a promising approach to automatically provide clinically relevant cerebral microbleeds metrics. KEY POINTS: We present a method to automatically characterise cerebral microbleeds according to size and location. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 2.5 mm for size estimation. Automated rating for infratentorial, deep, and lobar regions achieved an over 90% overall accuracy.

39097167,Single-Cell Advances in Investigating and Understanding Chronic Kidney Disease and Diabetic Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its subset diabetic kidney disease are progressive conditions that affect >850 million people worldwide. Diabetes, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis are the most common causes of CKD, which is associated with significant patient morbidity and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, ultimately leading to premature death. Despite newly approved drugs, increasing evidence shows that patients respond to treatment differently given the complexity of disease heterogeneity and complicated pathophysiology. This review article presents an integrative approach to understanding and addressing CKD through the lens of precision medicine and therapeutics. Advancements in single-cell omics technologies and artificial intelligence can be leveraged to explore the intricate cellular mechanisms underlying CKD and diabetic kidney disease pathogenesis. Dissecting the cellular heterogeneity and identifying rare cell populations using single-cell approaches will facilitate uncovering novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies. Finally, we discuss the potential of artificial intelligence-driven analyses in predicting disease progression and treatment response, thereby paving the way for tailored interventions.",The American journal of pathology
39859234,HERV-W Env Induces Neuron Pyroptosis via the NLRP3-CASP1-GSDMD Pathway in Recent-Onset Schizophrenia.,"HERVs (Human endogenous retroviruses) are remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses that have integrated into the human genome, particularly in germ-line cells. Among these, the envelope protein gene HERV-W env (Human endogenous retroviruses W family envelope protein), located on chromosome 7 and primarily expressed in the human placenta, has been closely linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as autoimmune diseases and cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the abnormal expression of cytokines as a key factor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Notably, elevated serum levels of IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta) in schizophrenia, a cytokine associated with inflammation, are a characteristic feature of pyroptosis-a form of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. Although previous research has observed significant upregulation of pyroptosis-related genes such as CASP1 (Caspase-1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) in the serum of schizophrenia patients, and extensive neuron pyroptosis has been documented in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, the occurrence of neuron pyroptosis in schizophrenia remains uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying pyroptosis in schizophrenia and its potential connection with HERV-W env have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of pyroptosis-related genes, specifically CASP1, GSDMD (Gasdermin D), and IL1B, were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between HERV-W env expression and the levels of CASP1/GSDMD/IL1B in these patients. Experimental evidence further demonstrated that HERV-W env promoted the activation of Caspase-1 and the cleavage of Gasdermin D, leading to increased release of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and IL-1β. Importantly, inhibitors targeting NLRP3, CASP1, and GSDMD significantly reduced the releases of LDH and IL-1β induced by HERV-W env, whereas BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) inhibitors did not have a notable effect. This suggests that HERV-W env induces CASP1-GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis through the NLRP3-CASP1-GSDMD signaling pathway. As pyroptosis is increasingly recognized for its connection to neurodegenerative diseases, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of HERV-W env. Additionally, it explores the potential facilitation of HERV-W env in the development of schizophrenia via pyroptosis, proposing that certain pyroptosis indicators could serve as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. Based on our existing research results and the findings of previous researchers, we infer that HERV-W env acts as a bridge in the onset and progression of schizophrenia. Furthermore, HERV-W env may serve as a potential target for the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, suggesting that monoclonal antibody therapy targeting HERV-W env could represent a novel approach to managing this disease.",International journal of molecular sciences
40034653,Development of a diagnostic checklist to identify functional cognitive disorder versus other neurocognitive disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Functional cognitive disorder (FCD) poses a diagnostic challenge due to its resemblance to other neurocognitive disorders and limited biomarker accuracy. We aimed to develop a new diagnostic checklist to identify FCD versus other neurocognitive disorders. METHODS: The clinical checklist was developed through mixed methods: (1) a literature review, (2) a three-round Delphi study with 45 clinicians from 12 countries and (3) a pilot discriminative accuracy study in consecutive patients attending seven memory services across the UK. Items gathering consensus were incorporated into a pilot checklist. Item redundancy was evaluated with phi coefficients. A briefer checklist was produced by removing items with >10% missing data. Internal validity was tested using Cronbach's alpha. Optimal cut-off scores were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: A full 11-item checklist and a 7-item briefer checklist were produced. Overall, 239 patients (143 FCD, 96 non-FCD diagnoses) were included. The checklist scores were significantly different across subgroups (FCD and other neurocognitive disorders) (F(2, 236)=313.3, p<0.001). The area under the curve was excellent for both the full checklist (0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99) and its brief version (0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.98). Optimal cut-off scores corresponded to a specificity of 97% and positive predictive value of 91% for identifying FCD. Both versions showed good internal validity (>0.80). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that a brief clinical checklist may serve as a quick complementary tool to differentiate patients with neurodegeneration from those with FCD. Prospective blind large-scale validation in diverse populations is warranted.Cite Now.",BMJ neurology open
40114783,LRRK2-associated parkinsonism with and without in vivo evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates: longitudinal clinical and biomarker characterization.,"Among LRRK2-associated parkinsonism cases with nigral degeneration, over two-thirds demonstrate evidence of pathologic alpha-synuclein, but many do not. Understanding the clinical phenotype and underlying biology in such individuals is critical for therapeutic development. Our objective was to compare clinical and biomarker features, and rate of progression over 4 years of follow-up, among LRRK2-associated parkinsonism cases with and without in vivo evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates. Data were from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, a multicentre prospective cohort study. The sample included individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease with pathogenic variants in LRRK2. Presence of CSF alpha-synuclein aggregation was assessed with seed amplification assay. A range of clinician- and patient-reported outcome assessments were administered. Biomarkers included dopamine transporter scan, CSF amyloid-beta(1-42), total tau, phospho-tau(181), urine bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate levels and serum neurofilament light chain. Linear mixed-effects (LMMs) models examined differences in trajectory in CSF-negative and CSF-positive groups. A total of 148 LRRK2 parkinsonism cases (86% with G2019S variant), 46 negative and 102 positive for CSF alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay, were included. At baseline, the negative group was older than the positive group [median (inter-quartile range) 69.1 (65.2-72.3) versus 61.5 (55.6-66.9) years, P < 0.001] and a greater proportion were female [28 (61%) versus 43 (42%), P = 0.035]. Despite being older, the negative group had similar duration since diagnosis and similar motor rating scale [16 (11-23) versus 16 (10-22), P = 0.480] though lower levodopa equivalents. Only 13 (29%) of the negative group were hyposmic, compared with 75 (77%) of the positive group. The negative group, compared with the positive group, had higher per cent-expected putamenal dopamine transporter binding for their age and sex [0.36 (0.29-0.45) versus 0.26 (0.22-0.37), P < 0.001]. Serum neurofilament light chain was higher in the negative group compared with the positive group [17.10 (13.60-22.10) versus 10.50 (8.43-14.70) pg/mL; age-adjusted P-value = 0.013]. In terms of longitudinal change, the negative group remained stable in functional rating scale score in contrast to the positive group who had a significant increase (worsening) of 0.729 per year (P = 0.037), but no other differences in trajectory were found. Among individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease with pathogenic variants in the LRRK2 gene, we found clinical and biomarker differences in cases without versus with in vivo evidence of CSF alpha-synuclein aggregates. LRRK2 parkinsonism cases without evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates as a group exhibit less severe motor manifestations and decline. The underlying biology in LRRK2 parkinsonism cases without evidence of alpha-synuclein aggregates requires further investigation.",Brain communications
40248348,Novel insights into the molecular nature of neurofilament light polypeptide species in cerebrospinal fluid.,"The quantification of neurofilament light polypeptide (NFL) in biofluids is being clinically used to detect and grade general neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases and quantify neuronal injury during acute events like traumatic brain injury. Specific assays that target only particular molecular breakdown products of neurofilaments have the potential to distinguish between various pathologies. Nevertheless, the molecular structure of neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid remains to be elucidated. We characterized neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid by size-exclusion chromatography, Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be composed of aggregates of fragments of the full-length molecule. These aggregates were sensitive to reduction by dithiothreitol and dissociated to monomeric fragments of 6-12 kDa (Western blot), covering most of the coiled-coil domains of neurofilament light polypeptide. Since only cysteine residues can form disulfide bonds, this points to a role of the single cysteine 322 for maintaining the stability of the aggregates. The sequence region covered by the identified fragments ended just a few amino acids C-terminally of the coiled-coil region at a site which had been previously mapped to a calpain cleavage site in the glial fibrillary acidic protein, which is highly homologous to neurofilament light polypeptide in the coiled-coil region. This cleavage site was also confirmed to be present in bovine neurofilament light polypeptide by in vitro digestion of purified neurofilament light polypeptide with calpain-1. The difference of the molecular weights of the reduced and non-reduced forms of neurofilament light polypeptide suggests that neurofilament light polypeptide in CSF consists of disulfide-linked aggregated fragments, most likely tetramers, or alternately dimers in a complex with another binding partner.",Brain communications

However, the sequence of events and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPT(Int10+3G>A) and MAPT(S305N;Int10+3G>A) lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance.",Nature neuroscience
40486666,Serum neurofilament light is superior to glial fibrillary acidic protein to distinguish sporadic frontotemporal dementia from late-onset primary psychiatric disorders: a retrospective DIPPA-FTD study.,"BACKGROUND: Sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is often misdiagnosed as late-onset primary psychiatric disorder (PPD). Previous research in small sample sizes has shown that neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are promising biomarkers to distinguish FTD from PPD. We aimed to investigate the discriminative value of NfL and GFAP in a multicentre cohort of sporadic bvFTD and late-onset PPD. METHODS: In total, n=275 sporadic bvFTD and n=82 PPD were included from our DIPPA-FTD study. Baseline serum NfL and GFAP levels were measured using Simoa. Biomarker levels were compared between groups. The effect of age and sex on NfL and GFAP was measured using linear regression models. Discriminative accuracies were assessed using logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves, corrected for age and sex. Within a subset of bvFTD patients who were deceased, the prognostic value of biomarkers was assessed by correlating disease duration (age at death minus age at blood sampling) with biomarker levels. RESULTS: Significantly higher serum median NfL and GFAP levels were found in sporadic bvFTD (NfL 33.3 pg/mL, IQR (19.6-49.6); GFAP 124.5 pg/mL, IQR (83.5-181.6)) compared with PPD (NfL 12.2 pg/mL, IQR (9.8-17.9); GFAP 68.9 pg/mL, IQR (50.6-95.0), both p<0.001). Discriminative performance was AUC=0.872 for NfL, AUC=0.787 for GFAP and AUC=0.878 for NfL+GFAP (DeLong's p for NfL+GFAP versus NfL AUCs: p=0.286). A shorter disease duration was significantly correlated with higher NfL, but not GFAP. CONCLUSION: Our study found that serum GFAP does not provide additional value as a discriminative marker compared with serum NfL alone when differentiating sporadic bvFTD from late-onset PPD.",BMJ neurology open
39805368,Peripheral blood immune cells from individuals with Parkinson's disease or inflammatory bowel disease share deficits in iron storage and transport that are modulated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder in which dysregulated neuroimmune crosstalk and inflammatory relay via the gut-blood-brain axis have been implicated in PD pathogenesis. Although alterations in circulating inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated with PD, no biomarkers have been identified that predict clinical progression or disease outcome. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, which involves perturbation of the underlying immune system, is an early and often-overlooked symptom that affects up to 80 % of individuals living with PD. Interestingly, 50-70 % of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a GI condition that has been epidemiologically linked to PD, display chronic illness-induced anemia - which drives toxic accumulation of iron in the gut. Ferroptotic (or iron loaded) cells have small and dysmorphic mitochondria-suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of iron accumulation. In pro-inflammatory environments, iron accumulates in immune cells, suggesting a possible connection and/or synergy between iron dysregulation and immune cell dysfunction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) recapitulate certain PD-associated neuropathological and inflammatory signatures and can act as communicating messengers in the gut-brain axis. Additionally, this communication can be modulated by several environmental factors; specifically, our data further support existing literature demonstrating a role for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in modulating immune transcriptional states in inflamed individuals. A mechanism linking chronic gut inflammation to iron dysregulation and mitochondrial function within peripheral immune cells has yet to be identified in conferring risk for PD. To that end, we isolated PBMCs and simultaneously evaluated their directed transcriptome and bioenergetic status, to investigate if iron dysregulation and mitochondrial sensitization are linked in individuals living with PD or IBD because of chronic underlying remittent immune activation. We have identified shared features of peripheral inflammation and immunometabolism in individuals living with IBD or PD that may contribute to the epidemiological association reported between IBD and risk for PD.",Neurobiology of disease
39630000,The involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and therapeutic implications.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a growing body of evidence implicating gut-brain axis dysfunction in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Accordingly, gut microbiota has become a promising target for the development of biomarkers and novel therapeutics for bipolar and depressive disorders. AREAS COVERED: We describe the observed changes in the gut microbiota of patients with mood disorders and discuss the available studies assessing microbiota-based strategies for their treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Microbiota-targeted interventions, such as symbiotics, prebiotics, paraprobiotics, and fecal microbiota transplants seem to attenuate the severity of depressive symptoms. The available results must be seen as preliminary and need to be replicated and/or confirmed in larger and independent studies, also considering the pathophysiological and clinical heterogeneity of mood disorders.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics
39974127,Reevaluating the Role of Education in Cognitive Decline and Brain Aging: Insights from Large-Scale Longitudinal Cohorts across 33 Countries.,"Why education is linked to higher cognitive function in aging is fiercely debated. Leading theories propose that education reduces brain decline in aging, enhances tolerance to brain pathology, or that it does not affect cognitive decline but rather reflects higher early-life cognitive function. To test these theories, we analyzed 407.356 episodic memory scores from 170.795 participants >50 years, alongside 15.157 brain MRIs from 6.472 participants across 33 Western countries. More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions. However, education did not protect against age-related decline or weakened effects of brain decline on cognition. The most parsimonious explanation for the results is that the associations reflect factors present early in life, including propensity of individuals with certain traits to pursue more education. While education has numerous benefits, the notion that it provides protection against cognitive or brain decline is not supported.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
39737468,Increased cell-free DNA in CSF and serum of hip fracture patients with delirium.,"Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome commonly presenting during acute illness. The pathophysiology of delirium is unknown, but neuroinflammation is suggested to play a role. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate whether cell-free DNA and markers of neutrophil extracellular traps in serum and CSF were associated with delirium and neuronal damage, assessed by neurofilament light chain. Hip fracture patients (n = 491) with a median (25, 75 percentiles) age of 83 (74, 88) years and 69% females were enrolled at Oslo University Hospital, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Akershus University Hospital and Bærum Hospital. Delirium was assessed daily, pre- and postoperatively. Cognitively healthy adults (n = 32) with a median (25, 75 percentiles) age of 75 (70, 77) years and 53% females were included as controls. Cell-free DNA was measured by using the fluorescent nucleic acid stain Quant-iT PicoGreen® in serum and CSF. Myeloperoxidase-DNA and citrullinated histone H3 were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum. Hip fracture patients have significantly higher levels of cell-free DNA and neutrophil extracellular traps in blood than cognitively healthy controls. In hip fracture patients without dementia, cell-free DNA in CSF and serum was significantly higher in patients with (n = 68) versus without (n = 221) delirium after adjusting for age and sex (70 (59, 84) versus 62 (53, 77) ng/ml, P = 0.037) and 601 (504, 684) versus 508 (458, 572) ng/ml, P = 0.007, respectively). In the total hip fracture cohort, CSF levels of cell-free DNA and neurofilament light chain were significantly correlated after adjusting for age and sex (r = 0.441, P < 0.001). The correlation was stronger in those with delirium (r = 0.468, P < 0.001) and strongest in delirious patients without dementia (r = 0.765, P = 0.045). In delirious patients without dementia, significantly higher levels of cell-free DNA in CSF and serum were shown. The association between cell-free DNA and neurofilament light chain suggest simultaneous release of cell-free DNA and neuronal damage during delirium.",Brain communications
39652340,Discontinuation of First-Line Disease-Modifying Therapy in Patients With Stable Multiple Sclerosis: The DOT-MS Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Increasing numbers of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) use disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Long-term stable disease while taking such medications provides a rationale for considering DMT discontinuation given patient burden, costs, and potential adverse effects of immunomodulating therapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether first-line DMT can be safely discontinued in patients with long-term stable MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, rater-blinded, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted between July 1, 2020, and March 20, 2023, at 14 Dutch centers. Data analysis was performed between July 2023 and January 2024. Key inclusion criteria were relapse-onset MS, aged 18 years or older, without relapses, and without substantial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity in the previous 5 years under first-line DMT. Participants were randomized 1:1 to discontinue or continue first-line DMT. INTERVENTION: Discontinuation of first-line DMT. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was significant inflammatory disease activity, defined as relapse and/or 3 or more new T2 lesions or 2 or more contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI. RESULTS: Of 163 potentially eligible participants, 89 participants were included in the trial at the moment of early termination. Forty-four participants (49.4%) were assigned to the continue group and 45 participants (50.6%) were assigned to the discontinue group. Median (IQR) age was 54.0 (49.0-59.0) years, and 60 participants (67.4%) were female. Two participants in the continue group were lost to follow-up. After a median (IQR) follow-up time of 15.3 (11.4-23.9) months, the trial was prematurely terminated because of inflammatory disease activity recurrence above the predefined limit. In total, 8 of 45 participants in the discontinue group (17.8%) vs 0 of 44 participants in the continue group reached the primary end point and had recurrent, mostly radiological inflammation. Two of these 8 participants had a clinical relapse. Median (IQR) time to disease activity was 12.0 (6.0-12.0) months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, even in patients with long-term MS stable for over 5 years, first-line DMT discontinuation can lead to recurrence of inflammatory disease activity. Although this study cohort was relatively small, the recurrence of inflammation in the discontinue group was significantly higher than in the continue group and also higher than in the previously published DISCOMS trial, which only included individuals aged 55 years or older. This study provides additional data, especially in a younger population and including longitudinal biomarker measurements, for informed decision-making in cases when treatment discontinuation is considered.

39097094,Female-Specific Association between the Apolipoprotein E E4 Allele and Age at Diagnosis of Glaucoma in UK Biobank.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele in the gender-specific aging process in glaucoma by illustrating the interaction between risk factors, including the APOE E4 allele, gender, and intraocular pressure (IOP), for age at diagnosis (AAD) of glaucoma. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study included UK Biobank participants with complete data (2006-2010) for analysis. Data were analyzed in December 2023. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand two hundred thirty-six glaucoma patients and 103 232 controls. METHODS: We evaluated multivariable-adjusted associations of AAD of glaucoma, APOE E4 allele (0: absence; 1: presence), and IOP using linear mixed model (LMM) analyses across groups stratified by AAD of mean age of menopause (50 years) and gender. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Age at diagnosis of glaucoma, APOE E4 allele, and IOP. RESULTS: Patients with glaucoma were older and had a higher percentage of males and a higher mean IOP compared to controls (all P < 0.001). Further stratifying the patients with glaucoma by AAD of 50 and gender, lower IOP (model 1 adjusted by age, β(IOP) = -0.096 ± 0.041, P = 0.019), and positive APOE E4 allele (model 2 adjusted by age and IOP, β(e4) = 1.093 ± 0.488, P = 0.026) were associated with an older AAD in females with an AAD <50 years under univariate LMM. In multivariate LMM adjusted by age (model 3), the effect size of both factors increased in the multivariate model as the beta-value increased (β(IOP) = -0.111 ± 0.040, P = 0.007; β(e4) = 1.235 ± 0.485, P = 0.012) (model 1 vs. model 3: P = 0.011). In females with an AAD ≥50 years, only positive APOE E4 allele (adjusted by age and IOP, β(e4) = -1.121 ± 0.412, P = 0.007) was associated with a younger AAD. In males, only higher IOP was associated with an older AAD in those with an AAD ≥50 years (β(IOP) = 0.088 ± 0.032, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Apolipoprotein E E4 allele may initially delay and later accelerate the development of glaucoma in females around the transition period of 50 years, which is the mean age of menopause, and importantly, this is independent of IOP. Understanding the specific transition states and modifiable factors within each age phase is crucial for developing interventions or strategies that promote healthy aging.

39839839,Polygenic risk scores for atrial fibrillation and heart failure and the risk of stroke and dementia.,"Atrial fibrillation and heart failure have both been suggested to increase stroke and dementia risk. However, in observational studies, reversed causation and unmeasured confounding may occur. To mitigate these issues, this study aims to investigate if higher genetic risk for atrial fibrillation and heart failure increases dementia and stroke risk. Data were obtained from the population-based Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies in Sweden. Participants (N = 984) were born in 1930 with baseline examinations at age 70, 75, 79 or 85 and follow-ups until age 88-89. Polygenic risk scores at the 5 × 10(-8), 1 × 10(-5), 1 × 10(-3) and 1 × 10(-1) thresholds were generated for atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Stroke was diagnosed based on self-reports, close-informant interviews, and the National Patient Register. Dementia was diagnosed based on neuropsychiatric examinations, close-informant interviews, and the National Patient Register. Cox regression analyses were performed, adjusted for sex, age at baseline and the first five principal components to correct for population stratification. Those within the highest atrial fibrillation-polygenic risk score tertile had a 1.5 (95% CI 1.09-2.03) increased risk of dementia (at the 1 × 10(-5) threshold) and a 1.5 (95% CI 1.07-2.03) increased risk of stroke (at the 1 × 10(-3) threshold) compared to the lowest tertile. Those within the highest heart failure-polygenic risk score tertile had a 1.6 (95% CI 1.19-2.27) increased risk of dementia (at the 5 × 10(-8) threshold), but no increased risk of stroke (HR 1.2; 95% CI 0.83-1.60 at the 1 × 10(-5) threshold), compared to the lowest tertile. When analysing the polygenic risk scores as a continuous variable, the associations were in the same direction, although weaker. This study, investigating genetic risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in relation to stroke and dementia, supports the increasing body of evidence suggesting that atrial fibrillation is associated with both stroke and dementia risk. Whether heart failure increases dementia risk is less established, but the present study found that genetic risk of heart failure increased dementia risk. The finding that genetic risk for heart failure did not increase stroke risk needs to be interpreted with caution, as it may be due to a lack of statistical power. There are guidelines on how to best treat atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, but more knowledge is needed on how to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure to prevent dementia.",Brain communications

39973498,The effect of polygenic risk score on PD risk and phenotype in LRRK2 G2019S and GBA1 carriers.,"BackgroundWhile LRRK2 and GBA1 variants are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), most carriers will not develop the disease.ObjectiveTo test if polygenic risk score (PRS) modifies disease risk and phenotypes in LRRK2 G2019S carriers, GBA1 carriers, and non-carriers (NC).MethodsWe genotyped 786 participants using Illumina's NeuroBooster-array (NBA) and sequenced the genome of 244, all of Ashkenazi ancestry (AJ), and calculated PRS to test its effects on clinically- and biologically-defined disease risk and phenotypes (n = 715). Among LRRK2 G2019S PD, we tested PRS association with α-synuclein seed-amplification-assay (n = 11). We used the PPMI and AMP-PD databases as validation cohorts.ResultsIn clinically-defined PD, PRS significantly modified disease risk in GBA1 carriers and in NC (p = 0.033 and p < 0.0001, respectively), and demonstrated a trend in LRRK2 G2019S carriers (p = 0.054), with similar effect sizes (OR = 1.55, 1.62, and 1.49, respectively). PRS association with PD risk in LRRK2 was primarily driven by the rs7938782-A risk allele, replicated in AMP-PD (268 AJs LRRK2 G2019S carriers). PRS and age-at-onset were negatively correlated in NC (p < 0.0001). NBA GBA1 genotype calls failed at GBA1 L483P and c.115 + 1G > A mutations. False negative call rate of 10.2% was observed for the imputed GBA1 N409S carriers.ConclusionsPRS contributes to PD risk across different genotypes. The genetic and epigenetic role of rs7938782 in LRRK2 PD risk should be further explored. Future PRS models should be tailored to specific genotypes to better understand penetrance and phenotypes. Furthermore, models predicting PD defined biologically rather than clinically may further identify genetic risk factors for synucleinopathies.",Journal of Parkinson's disease
39841719,"Female Brain and Endocrinological Research-Veteran (FemBER-Vet) study: A study protocol for identifying endocrinological, lifestyle and psychosocial determinants of brain health outcomes in female veterans for future intervention success.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated a greater risk of dementia in female veterans compared to civilians; with the highest prevalence noted for former service women with a diagnosis of psychiatric (trauma, alcoholism, depression), and/or a physical health condition (brain injury, insomnia, diabetes). Such findings highlight the need for increased and early screening of medical and psychiatric conditions, and indeed dementia, in the female veteran population. Further, they call for a better understanding of the underlying biopsychosocial mechanisms that might confer heightened risk for female veterans, to tailor preventative and interventional strategies that support brain health across the lifespan. METHODS: The Female Brain and Endocrinological Research-Veteran (FemBER-Vet) Study will create a highly-phenotyped readiness cohort of ex-service persons as well as non-veterans to assess the impacts of, and risks associated with, military service on brain health, using state-of-the-art non-invasive cognitive, physiological and biomarker capture techniques. FEMBER-Vet will include 90 participants across three study groups (30 female veterans, 30 male veterans, 30 female civilians) to delineate the precise biological, socio-demographic, health, lifestyle, military-related, and life-course determinants of brain health outcomes (psychosocial, cognitive, neurophysiological, and other biomarkers). DISCUSSION: This work addresses the poorly understood biopsychosocial outcomes that female veterans experience compared to their male counterparts and the general female population. Ultimately, it will provide evidence to support the development of tailored interventions for an emerging health priority that currently lacks sufficient evidence for screening and therapeutic intervention.",PloS one
39692213,"White matter free water mediates the associations between placental growth factor, white matter hyperintensities, and cognitive status.","INTRODUCTION: Placental growth factor (PlGF) may regulate cerebrovascular permeability. We hypothesized that white matter interstitial fluid accumulation, estimated via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) free water (FW), would explain the associations between elevated PlGF, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cognitive impairment. METHODS: MarkVCID consortium participants ≥55 years old with plasma PlGF and brain MRI were included. We tested cross-sectionally whether FW mediated the associations between PlGF and WMH, or PlGF and cognition, measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and an executive function (EF) composite (Uniform Data Set version 3 [UDS3]-EF). RESULTS: For 370 participants (mean age 72), a higher PlGF was associated with higher FW, higher WMH, and higher CDR, but not UDS3-EF. Higher FW was associated with higher WMH, higher CDR, and lower UDS3-EF. FW explained 26% of the association between PlGF and CDR and 73% of the association between PlGF and WMH. DISCUSSION: Elevated PlGF may contribute to WMH and cognitive impairment through white matter FW accumulation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06284213 HIGHLIGHTS: PlGF is a promising blood-based biomarker for vascular cognitive impairment. In MarkVCID, higher PlGF was associated with accumulated white matter FW on MRI. FW mediated the association between higher PlGF and MRI-visible white matter injury.

40322777,Microglia positron emission tomography and progression in multiple sclerosis: thalamus on fire.,"Increased innate immune activity promotes neurodegeneration and contributes to progression in multiple sclerosis. This prospective case-control study aims to investigate thalamic microglia density on 18kDa translocator protein PET in patients with multiple sclerosis using a third-generation radioligand, (11)C-ER176, and investigate the associations of (11)C-ER176 PET uptake with imaging and clinical measures of progression in multiple sclerosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 50) and controls (n = 55) were prospectively enrolled and they underwent (11)C-ER176 PET and MRI including diffusion MRI with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging. Disease characteristics, expanded disability status scale and multiple sclerosis functional composite scores were obtained in patients with multiple sclerosis. Age at imaging (mean ± standard deviation: patients = 49.6 ± 12.9 years, controls = 48.2 ± 15.4 years, P = 0.63) and sex (female ratio; patients = 72%, controls = 65%, P = 0.47) were not different between the groups. Thalamus (11)C-ER176 PET uptake was highest in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (1.272 ± 0.072 standardized uptake value ratio), followed by patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (1.209 ± 0.074 standardized uptake value ratio) and lowest in controls (1.162 ± 0.067 standardized uptake value ratio, P < 0.001). Patients with thalamic lesions had higher thalamus (11)C-ER176 PET uptake than those without thalamic lesions in both relapsing multiple sclerosis and progressive multiple sclerosis (P < 0.001). In patients with multiple sclerosis, higher thalamus (11)C-ER176 PET uptake correlated with lower thalamic volume (r = -0.45, P = 0.001), higher mean diffusivity (r = 0.56, P < 0.001), lower neurite density index (r = -0.43, P = 0.002), lower orientation dispersion index (r = -0.40, P = 0.005) and higher free water fraction (r = 0.42, P = 0.003) in the thalamus. In patients with multiple sclerosis, higher thalamus (11)C-ER176 PET uptake also correlated with higher mean diffusivity (r = 0.47, P < 0.001) and lower neurite density index (r = -0.36, P = 0.012) in the corpus callosum. In patients with multiple sclerosis, higher thalamus (11)C-ER176 PET uptake correlated with worse expanded disability status scale scores (r = 0.33, P = 0.02), paced auditory serial addition test scores (r = -0.43, P = 0.003) and multiple sclerosis functional composite z-scores (r = -0.46, P = 0.001). Microglia density in the thalamus is highest in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis and is associated with imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration and clinical disease severity. As a signature imaging biomarker of progression in multiple sclerosis, effectively reflecting the global disease burden, (11)C-ER176 PET may aid development and efficacy evaluation of therapeutics targeting microglia.",Brain communications
39879572,Association of Year-to-Year Lipid Variability With Risk of Cognitive Decline and Dementia in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lipid metabolism in older adults is affected by various factors including biological aging, functional decline, reduced physiologic reserve, and nutrient intake. The dysregulation of lipid metabolism could adversely affect brain health. This study investigated the association between year-to-year intraindividual lipid variability and subsequent risk of cognitive decline and dementia in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was a randomized trial of aspirin, involving 19,114 participants aged 65 years and older from Australia and the United States who were free of dementia and major cognitive impairment. ASPREE-eXTension is the post-trial observational follow-up of participants, currently to a maximum of 11 years. This post hoc analysis included participants who had lipid levels measured at baseline and in years 1, 2, and 3. Year-to-year variability in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides over the first 3 years was quantified using variability independent of the mean. Individuals who initiated or discontinued lipid-lowering therapy during this period were excluded. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze associations with incident dementia, adjudicated by expert panels, and cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND) confirmed by a battery of cognitive tests, occurring after year 3. A linear mixed model was used for assessing the association with changes in 4 cognitive function domains, including global, memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, and a composite score from baseline to the end of follow-up. RESULTS: The analysis included 9,846 individuals (median [interquartile range] age: 73.9 [71.7-77.3] years, 54.9% female). 509 incident dementia and 1,760 CIND events were recorded over a median follow-up of 5.8 and 5.4 years after variability assessment. The hazard ratios (95% CI) comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of TC and LDL-c variability were 1.60 (1.23-2.08) and 1.48 (1.15-1.91) for dementia and 1.23 (1.08-1.41) and 1.27 (1.11-1.46) for CIND. Higher TC and LDL-c variability was also associated with a faster decline in global cognition, episodic memory, psychomotor speed, and the composite score (all p < 0.001). No strong evidence was found for an association of HDL-c and triglyceride variability with dementia and cognitive change. DISCUSSION: Tracking variability of TC and LDL-c may serve as a novel biomarker of incident dementia and cognitive decline in older adults.",Neurology
39798256,Blood-brain barrier water permeability across the adult lifespan: A multi-echo ASL study.,"An emerging biomarker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is the time of exchange (Tex) of water from the blood to tissue, as measured by multi-echo arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. This new non-invasive sequence, already tested in mice, has recently been adapted to humans and optimized for clinical scanning time. In this study, we studied the normal variability of Tex over age and sex, which needs to be established as a reference for studying changes in neurological disease. We evaluated Tex, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT) in 209 healthy adults between 26 and 87 years, over age and sex, using general linear models in gray matter, white matter, and regionally in cerebral lobes. After QC, 194 participants were included in the main analysis, and the results demonstrated that both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) BBB permeability was higher with higher age (Tex lower by 0.47 ms per year in GM [p < 0.05], and by 0.49 ms in WM, for females; no significant for males), with the largest Tex difference in the frontal lobes (0.64 ms decrease per year, p = 0.011, population average). CBF was lower with higher age in the GM (-0.71 mL/min/100g per year, p < 0.001, for females; -0.31 mL/min/100g per year, p < 0.05, for males). When correcting Tex models for CBF and ATT, effect of age on Tex disappears in the GM, but not in the WM (β=-0.28, p = 0.08).

39996031,Retinal vasculometry associations with cognition status in UK Biobank.,"INTRODUCTION: Retinal vasculometry (RV) provides a neurovascular biomarker which may relate to cognitive status. However, the presence and form of association remains unclear and unexamined at scale. METHODS: Artificial intelligence-enabled RV measures from 66,350 UK Biobank study participants were related to combined cognition scores. Differences in RV were examined per standard deviation (SD) increase in cognitive score, using multilevel linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, measurement center, ethnicity, and within-person RV clustering. RESULTS: One hundred ten thousand two hundred eighty-two retinal images from 63,165 (95%) participants (mean age 56.6 years, 55.5% female) were analyzed. A one SD increase in cognition score was strongly associated with increased arteriolar width, arteriolar tortuosity, increased venular width particularly among those < 50 years and venular area among those > 50 years; also, inversely associated with venular tortuosity, and arteriolar and venular width variance. DISCUSSION: These easily accessible, affordable, and non-invasive RV measures should be evaluated further as an early predictor of future neurodegenerative disease. HIGHLIGHTS: How cognitive status relates to retinal vasculometry (RV) measures remains uncertain and unexamined at scale.Using data from a large population-based study (UK Biobank) we show strong graded associations between cognitive status and RV, which contrast with some RV associations observed with aging. Specifically, increased arteriolar tortuosity, arteriolar and venular width (at younger ages), and area are positively associated, and venular tortuosity and arteriolar and venular width variability are inversely associated with higher cognitive status, all showing strong, graded, precise relationships. These associations appeared to be strongest for fluid intelligence and prospective memory tests.These easily accessible, non-invasive RV measures provide a neurovascular marker indicative of cognitive status, which should be evaluated as early predictors of neurodegenerative disease.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40585815,The temporal dynamics and clinical relevance of choroid plexus measures in multiple sclerosis.,"Choroid plexus enlargement is a promising biomarker of disease activity in multiple sclerosis. However, longitudinal changes in choroid plexus volume and microstructural integrity remain unclear. This study investigated temporal changes in choroid plexus measures and their correlations with clinical disability and brain volume changes over 18 months and the entire disease duration. We recruited consecutive relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at treatment initiation who were then invited to come back for clinical, neuropsychological and brain MRI assessments at 6 and 18 months. Choroid plexus volume was measured using FreeSurfer and Gaussian Mixture Models on 3D-T1-weighted scans, and choroid plexus T1/T2 ratio was calculated from conventional 3D-T1- and T2-weighted images. Brain lesion, whole brain, grey matter, and white matter volumes were measured. Alternating conditional expectation algorithm was used to estimate trajectories of changes in choroid plexus measures over the entire disease course. Multiple linear regression and mixed effects models were used to investigate associations of choroid plexus measures with clinical and MRI measures. False discovery rate correction was applied. 422 RRMS patients were recruited [mean age: 40.8 years (SD 10.9), mean disease duration: 9.5 years (SD 17.4), median expanded disability status scale: 2.0 (IQR: 1.5-3.5); mean symbol digit modalities test score: 50.6 (SD 14.7), mean brief visuospatial memory test-revised score: 25 (SD7.6)]; 276 participants were studied at 6-months follow-up and 80 at 18-months. During the entire disease course, an initial increase in normalized choroid plexus volume was observed, followed by a plateau; T1/T2 ratio decreased initially, but then increased once the volume had stabilized. When examining changes in choroid plexus volumes over a median follow-up of 8.6 months, significant increases in both choroid plexus volumes [β = 0.45, standard error = 0.11, False discovery rate-corrected P < 0.001)] and T1/T2 ratios (β = 0.29, standard error = 0.14, False discovery rate-corrected P = 0.05) were observed. A higher baseline choroid plexus T1/T2 ratio was linked to a faster rate of decrease in normalized brain volume (β = -0.21, standard error = 0.08, False discovery rate-corrected P = 0.01) and deep grey matter volume (β = -0.25, standard error = 0.10, False discovery rate-corrected P = 0.03) over time. Higher baseline choroid plexus T1/T2 values were associated with worsening performance on brief visuospatial memory test-revised over time (β = -0.23, standard error = 0.10, False discovery rate-corrected P = 0.04). Changes in choroid plexus measures over time appear non-linear, with volumes increasing earlier in the disease course and T1/T2 ratios rising later. After a mean disease duration of 9.5 years, higher choroid plexus T1/T2 ratios, but not volume, predicted faster memory decline and whole brain and deep grey matter volume loss, underscoring the value of assessing choroid plexus microstructure, alongside volumes, in predicting clinical and MRI outcomes.",Brain communications
40017899,Predictive value and weight of factors associated with cognitive performance in Hispanics/Latinos enrolled in the Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities.,"INTRODUCTION: In this analysis of cognitively unimpaired (CU) Hispanic participants from the Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD), we aimed to identify the main predictor factors for cognitive performance and their relative importance (weight). METHODS: The HABS-HD is a community-based longitudinal cohort study. Data from 952 CU Hispanics, enrolled from 2017 to February 2024, were analyzed. Random forest, an assembly learning method based on decision trees, was used to cross-sectionally forecast the predictive value of 42 risk factors (4 demographic variables, 4 socioeconomic variables, 6 psychosocial variables, 17 health variables, and 11 plasma and magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers) together, and the weighting of each factor for different cognitive domains (global cognition, memory, language, executive function, attention, and processing speed). RESULTS: Participants included in the analyses had a mean age of 61.3 years (9.14), 69.4% were female, and had a mean of 10.52 (4.61) years of education. Income, glucose levels, plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)42, total tau, and neurofilament light chain were in the top 10 predictors in six cognitive domains. Age, education years, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, body mass index, and C-reactive protein were the main predictors in four cognitive domains, while plasma Aβ40 was in the top 10 list for five cognitive domains. DISCUSSION: Results support the notion that cognitive performance depends on interactions among social, economic, biological, and functional factors. The effects of factors together, and the weight of each factor in various cognitive domains may be different in Hispanics. More studies comparing different ethnic groups are necessary to help in the development of tailored interventions to prevent cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Numerous factors have been associated with cognitive decline and dementia.Research on these factors has relied on a meta-analysis of their individual association with cognition, consolidating data from different non-Hispanic White populations.Hispanics are the largest minority group in the United States, and only a few studies have analyzed the overall impact of these factors together, and their individual relative effect in different cognitive domains.We found that cognitive performance in Hispanics may be a result of interactions among social, economic, biological, and functional factors.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40135150,Machine learning to discover factors predicting volume of white matter hyperintensities: Insights from the UK Biobank.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) reflect the risks of stroke, dementia, and overall mortality. METHODS: We used a hypothesis-free gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach and conventional statistical methods to discover risk factors associated with volume of WMHs. The GBDT models considered data on 2891 input features, collected ∼10 years prior to volume of WMH measurements from 44,053 participants. Top 3% of features, ranked by Shapley values, were taken forward to epidemiological analyses using linear regression. RESULTS: Adiposity, lung function, and indicators of metabolic health (eg, glycated hemoglobin, hypertension, alkaline phosphatase, microalbumin, and urate) contribute to WMH prediction. Of lifestyle factors, smoking had the strongest association. Time spent outdoors, creatinine, and several red blood cell indices were among the identified less-known predictors of WMHs. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, high blood pressure, lung function, metabolic abnormalities, and lifestyle are key contributors to WMHs, providing opportunities to prevent or reduce their development. HIGHLIGHTS: Obesity and related metabolic abnormalities were linked with WMHs.Associations with time spent outdoors, creatinine, some red blood cell indices and height were among the less-known risk factors identified.Action on blood pressure, metabolic abnormalities, and adequate oxygenation may help to prevent WMHs.Biomarker links may suggest simple blood tests could aid in early dementia prediction.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
40487744,Correlation analyses between MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and monoamine levels in dementia with Lewy bodies show potential link with the serotonergic system.,"SETTING: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) remains poorly understood and frequently misdiagnosed, complicated by co-pathology with other dementia forms. DLB patients often present with autonomic dysfunction and peripheral Lewy body pathology alongside central lesions. Monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems seem an early target for DLB pathology, especially the noradrenergic system. Noradrenaline analogue (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is considered an indicative biomarker for peripheral noradrenergic sympathetic denervation. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to measure paired monoaminergic levels and MIBG scintigraphy values in DLB patients, exploring a possible link between noradrenergic neurotransmission and peripheral denervation. DESIGN: 44 patients with a possible DLB diagnosis entered the study. Peripheral uptake of (123)I-MIBG was determined by the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio, as a measure for noradrenergic sympathetic denervation. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and plasma samples, monoamines ((nor)adrenaline ((N)A), 5-hydroxytryptamin (5-HT, serotonin), dopamine (DA)) and respective metabolites (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)), were measured by means of reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. RESULTS: We found significant correlations between the H/M ratio and serum 5-HIAA, plasma 5-HT, plasma 5-HIAA/5-HT and plasma HVA/5-HIAA, but no further correlations with the noradrenergic system. CSF-serum MHPG, CSF-serum DOPAC, CSF-serum HVA, CSF-plasma MHPG, CSF plasma NA, CSF-plasma DOPAC, CSF-plasma MHPG/NA and CSF-plasma DOPAC/DA were significantly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: These results show an association between the H/M ratio and serotonergic system, but not between peripheral noradrenergic denervation and circulating noradrenergic levels.",Clinical parkinsonism & related disorders
39832176,Retracted: A Dynamic Adaptive Ensemble Learning Framework for Noninvasive Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection: Development and Validation Study.,"BACKGROUND: The prompt and accurate identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial for preventing its progression into more severe neurodegenerative diseases. However, current diagnostic solutions, such as biomarkers and cognitive screening tests, prove costly, time-consuming, and invasive, hindering patient compliance and the accessibility of these tests. Therefore, exploring a more cost-effective, efficient, and noninvasive method to aid clinicians in detecting MCI is necessary. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an ensemble learning framework that adaptively integrates multimodal physiological data collected from wearable wristbands and digital cognitive metrics recorded on tablets, thereby improving the accuracy and practicality of MCI detection. METHODS: We recruited 843 participants aged 60 years and older from the geriatrics and neurology departments of our collaborating hospitals, who were randomly divided into a development dataset (674/843 participants) and an internal test dataset (169/843 participants) at a 4:1 ratio. In addition, 226 older adults were recruited from 3 external centers to form an external test dataset. We measured their physiological signals (eg, electrodermal activity and photoplethysmography) and digital cognitive parameters (eg, reaction time and test scores) using the clinically certified Empatica 4 wristband and a tablet cognitive screening tool. The collected data underwent rigorous preprocessing, during which features in the time, frequency, and nonlinear domains were extracted from individual physiological signals. To address the challenges (eg, the curse of dimensionality and increased model complexity) posed by high-dimensional features, we developed a dynamic adaptive feature selection optimization algorithm to identify the most impactful subset of features for classification performance. Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the classification model were improved by optimizing the combination of base learners. RESULTS: The experimental results indicate that the proposed MCI detection framework achieved classification accuracies of 88.4%, 85.5%, and 84.5% on the development, internal test, and external test datasets, respectively. The area under the curve for the binary classification task was 0.945 (95% CI 0.903-0.986), 0.912 (95% CI 0.859-0.965), and 0.904 (95% CI 0.846-0.962) on these datasets. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of feature subsets during the iterative modeling process revealed that the decay time of skin conductance response, the percentage of continuous normal-to-normal intervals exceeding 50 milliseconds, the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency (LF/HF) components in heart rate variability, and cognitive time features emerged as the most prevalent and effective indicators. Specifically, compared with healthy individuals, patients with MCI exhibited a longer skin conductance response decay time during cognitive testing (P<.001), a lower percentage of continuous normal-to-normal intervals exceeding 50 milliseconds (P<.001), and higher LF/HF (P<.001), accompanied by greater variability. Similarly, patients with MCI took longer to complete cognitive tests than healthy individuals (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The developed MCI detection framework has demonstrated exemplary performance and stability in large-scale validations. It establishes a new benchmark for noninvasive, effective early MCI detection that can be integrated into routine wearable and tablet-based assessments. Furthermore, the framework enables continuous and convenient self-screening within home or nonspecialized settings, effectively mitigating underresourced health care and geographic location constraints, making it an essential tool in the current fight against neurodegenerative diseases.",JMIR medical informatics
39711521,Interocular retinal asymmetry and cognitive frailty: A prospective cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) or ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) is associated with cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between retinal asymmetry and cognitive frailty (CF) remains unknown. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-two community-dwelling older adults were assessed starting in 2015 and underwent biennial cognitive and frailty evaluations until 2022. Retinal asymmetry was defined as the absolute interocular retinal difference. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the risk of CF over time. RESULTS: Among the participants, 158 completed the 4-year follow-up. Greater baseline GC-IPL asymmetry was associated with worsening CF over time (adjusted odds ratio = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.10), with handgrip strength asymmetry significantly modifying this association (p(interaction )= 0.02). GC-IPL asymmetry was associated with cognitive impairment ( β̂ = -1.69 × 10(-2); 95% CI = -3.13 × 10(-2), -0.25 × 10(-2)) but not with physical frailty. RNFL showed no significant association with CF. DISCUSSION: Interocular GC-IPL asymmetry might be a new biomarker for CF in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Interocular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) asymmetry was associated with impaired memory-frailty, with handgrip strength asymmetry significantly modifying this association. Interocular GC-IPL asymmetry was associated with cognitive impairment. Interocular retinal asymmetry might be a structural biomarker of cognitive frailty.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
39822287,Acoustic speech features are associated with late-life depression and apathy symptoms: Preliminary findings.,"BACKGROUND: Late-life depression (LLD) is a heterogenous disorder related to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative processes, raising a need for the development of novel biomarkers. We sought to provide preliminary evidence for acoustic speech signatures sensitive to LLD and their relationship to depressive dimensions. METHODS: Forty patients (24 female, aged 65-82 years) were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Vocal features were extracted from speech samples (reading a pre-written text) and tested as classifiers of LLD using random forest and XGBoost models. Post hoc analyses examined the relationship between these acoustic features and specific depressive dimensions. RESULTS: The classification models demonstrated moderate discriminative ability for LLD with receiver operating characteristic = 0.78 for random forest and 0.84 for XGBoost in an out-of-sample testing set. The top classifying features were most strongly associated with the apathy dimension (R (2) = 0.43). DISCUSSION: Acoustic vocal features that may support the diagnosis of LLD are preferentially associated with apathy. HIGHLIGHTS: The depressive dimensions in late-life depression (LLD) have different cognitive correlates, with apathy characterized by more pronounced cognitive impairment.Acoustic speech features can predict LLD. Using acoustic features, we were able to train a random forest model to predict LLD in a held-out sample.Acoustic speech features that predict LLD are preferentially associated with apathy. These results indicate a predominance of apathy in the vocal signatures of LLD, and suggest that the clinical heterogeneity of LLD should be considered in development of acoustic markers.","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
39863325,Blood-brain barrier integrity disruption is associated with both chronic vascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) like hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus are increasingly linked to cognitive decline and dementia, especially in cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are closely associated with cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms behind their development remain unclear. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may be a key factor, particularly in cSVD. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relationship between CRFs, BBB integrity, and WMH burden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included 155 participants from the Biomarkers and Cognition Study, Singapore (BIOCIS). CRFs were assessed through blood tests for glucose and lipid profiles, and blood pressure measurements. WMH volumes were quantified using MRI. MEASUREMENTS: BBB integrity was evaluated using a Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) assay with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) exposed to participant plasma. RESULTS: Plasma from individuals with a higher WMH burden was associated with increased BBB disruption in hBMEC. Higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as body mass index, were correlated with greater BBB disruption. Regression analyses revealed that elevated blood glucose and lipid levels were linked to increased BBB disruption. Both periventricular and subcortical WMH burdens were associated with increased BBB disruption. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a relationship between CRFs, BBB disruption, and WMH burden, suggesting that CRFs may impair BBB integrity and contribute to WMH and cognitive decline in cSVD.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease
39759948,Association of corneal endothelial cell morphology with neurodegeneration in mild cognitive impairment and dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) detects neurodegeneration in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and identifies subjects with MCI who develop dementia. This study assessed whether abnormalities in corneal endothelial cell (CEC) morphology are related to corneal nerve morphology, brain volumetry, cerebral ischemia, and cognitive impairment in MCI and dementia. METHODS: Participants with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and dementia underwent CCM to quantify corneal endothelial cell density (CECD) and area (CECA), corneal nerve fiber morphology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain volumetry, and severity of brain ischemia. RESULTS: Of the 114 participants, 14 had NCI, 77 had MCI, and 23 had dementia. CECD (1971.3 ± 594.6 vs 2316.1 ± 499.5 cells/mm(2), p < 0.05) was significantly lower in the dementia compared to the NCI group. CECD and CECA were comparable between the MCI and NCI groups (p = 0.13-0.65). Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) (31.7 ± 5.6 vs 24.5 ± 9.2 and 17.3 ± 5.3 fibers/mm(2), p < 0.01), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD) (111.8 ± 58.1 vs 50.4 ± 36.4 and 52.7 ± 21.3 branches/mm(2), p < 0.0001), and corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) (24.6 ± 6.6 vs 16.5 ± 6.8 and 16.2 ± 5.0 mm/mm(2), p < 0.0001) were lower in the MCI and dementia groups compared to the NCI group. Lower CECD partially mediated the impact of age and diabetes on CNFL reduction (p < 0.05), whereas CECA lost its significance after adjustment (p = 0.20). CEC morphology does not affect the association between corneal nerve fiber loss and MCI/dementia. CECD and CECA had no significant association with cerebral ischemic lesions (p = 0.21-0.47), dementia (p = 0.11-0.35), or cognitive decline (p = 0.37-0.38). However, lower CECD and higher CECA were associated with decreased cortical gray matter volume (p < 0.05-0.01). DISCUSSION: CEC loss occurs in patients with dementia, and both endothelial cell loss and hypertrophy are associated with cortical gray matter atrophy. CNF loss occurs in individuals with MCI and dementia. Corneal nerve and endothelial cell abnormalities could act as biomarkers for neurovascular pathology in dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Corneal endothelial cell density is significantly reduced in patients with dementia.Corneal nerve fiber density, branch density, and length are lower in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.Corneal endothelial cell loss and hypertrophy are associated with cortical gray matter atrophy.Corneal nerve and endothelial cell abnormalities could act as biomarkers for neurovascular pathology in dementia.Reduced corneal endothelial cell density partially mediates the effects of age and diabetes on corneal nerve fiber loss.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40519238,"The effect of aerobic exercise on cerebral perfusion in patients with vascular cognitive impairment, the Excersion-VCI randomised controlled clinical trial.","Aerobic exercise may improve cerebral perfusion and may thereby attenuate, or delay, cognitive decline. Excersion-VCI aimed to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on cerebral perfusion in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). This Randomized Controlled Trial included non-demented adults ≥50 years diagnosed with VCI. Patients were randomly assigned either home-based aerobic interval training (exercise group) or information sessions (control group). Primary outcome was change in Arterial Spin Labelling MRI grey matter cerebral perfusion from baseline to 14-week follow-up. Per-protocol analysis was performed in patients who completed the follow-up. Secondary outcomes were VO(2max) and cognitive function. Exploratory outcomes were depression and apathy, White Matter Hyperintensities, cerebral volumes, and blood biomarkers. Fifty-eight VCI patients (mean age 67.0 ± 6.7 years) were allocated to the exercise (n = 28) or control group (n = 30). Intention-to-treat analyses showed that change in grey matter cerebral perfusion in the exercise group did not differ from the control group (p = 0.38), nor were there group differences in change in VO2max (p = 0.17). The exercise group showed an increase in triglycerides compared to the control group (p = 0.04). No group differences were found for other outcomes. Per protocol analyses showed improvement in VO(2max) in the exercise group compared to the control group (p = 0.04). An aerobic exercise program in VCI patients improved cardiorespiratory fitness in those who adhered to the protocol, but did not show significant effects on grey matter cerebral perfusion or other outcomes. The intervention duration of 14-weeks may have been too short to measure changes in perfusion or improvements in cognitive function.",Cerebral circulation - cognition and behavior
40488179,Differentiating sporadic frontotemporal dementia from late-onset primary psychiatric disorders.,"Sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is often misdiagnosed as late-onset primary psychiatric disorder (PPD) due to overlapping symptoms and lack of biomarkers. We aimed to identify clinical features that distinguish sporadic bvFTD from PPD. Multi-centre baseline data were retrospectively retrieved and categorized into neuropsychological domains. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves were conducted to determine discriminators. Data from 508 sporadic bvFTD and 152 PPD cases were included. Higher scores in cognitive screening [odds ratio (OR): 1.23], facial emotion processing (OR: 1.69), episodic memory (OR: 1.09), animal fluency (OR: 1.17), working memory (OR: 1.18), letter fluency (OR: 1.17) and depressive symptoms (OR: 7.41) were significantly associated with PPD (all Ps ≤ 0.010). Within a combined model, higher scores of letter fluency (OR: 1.47), cognitive screening (OR: 1.72) and lower attention (OR: 0.77) were significantly (all Ps ≤ 0.05) associated with PPD (area under the curve = 0.771). Neuropsychological measurements-letter fluency, cognitive screening and attention-can help distinguish sporadic bvFTD from late-onset PPD. Depressive symptoms and facial emotion processing emerged as potential discriminators, warranting further exploration.",Brain communications
40589624,CITA GO-ON study. A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process.,"INTRODUCTION: Growing research suggests that dementia is a complex disorder with multiple risk factors and causes. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) demonstrated that lifestyle interventions could confer cognitive benefits. Inspired by this, the GOIZ-ZAINDU (GZ) feasibility study adapted the FINGER approach to the Basque context. Building upon the GZ study, the CITA GO-ON trial aims to enhance and expand the evidence supporting dementia prevention through a multidomain intervention of risk factor management and resilience promotion. METHODS: It is a two-year, population-based, randomized controlled trial to prevent cognitive decline in adults aged 60-85 years with Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) risk score ≥6, no dementia, and below-than-expected performance on at least one of three cognitive screening tests. Participants are randomized (1:1) to receive either Regular Health Advice (RHA) or a Multidomain Intervention (MD-Int) that encompasses cognitive training, socio-emotional skills, multicomponent physical exercise, nutritional and culinary intervention, and monitoring for cardiovascular risks, pharmacological drug mismanagement, and comorbidities. The primary outcome is the efficacy of the intervention to reduce the risk of cognitive decline measured by the global composite z-score of the modified Neuropsychological Test Battery over two years. The secondary outcomes measure cost-effectiveness, quality of life, and functional abilities. Blood samples and brain imaging will also be collected to evaluate the effects of the intervention on brain structure and plasma biomarkers. RESULTS: Recruitment has been completed with 1051 participants selected (mean age (standard deviation, SD) of 69.65 (6.36), 58,50 % female, and mean CAIDE (SD) of 7.62 (1.427). The final participant is expected to complete the last study visit by the autumn of 2026. DISCUSSION: The CITA GO-ON Study, as a part of the World-Wide FINGERS network, is designed to validate the efficacy of a multidomain lifestyle intervention for dementia prevention and contribute valuable data to inform public health strategies fostering healthy, active aging.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience
39794490,Medication use is associated with distinct microbial features in anxiety and depression.,"This study investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), specifically anxiety disorder (ANXD) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV or V criteria. The study also examined the influence of medication use, particularly antidepressants and/or anxiolytics, classified through the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, on the gut microbiota. Both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S) and shallow shotgun sequencing (WGS) were performed on DNA extracted from 666 fecal samples from the Tulsa-1000 and Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Affiliation and Personality Study Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (NeuroMAP CoBRE) cohorts. The results highlight the significant influence of medication use; antidepressant use is associated with significant differences in gut microbiota beta diversity and has a larger effect size than NPD diagnosis. Next, specific microbes were associated with ANXD and MDD, highlighting their potential for non-pharmacological intervention. Finally, the study demonstrated the capability of Random Forest classifiers to predict diagnoses of NPD and medication use from microbial profiles, suggesting a promising direction for the use of gut microbiota as biomarkers for NPD. Though the effect sizes were larger in females than males, similar trends emerged for both sexes. These findings encourage future research on the gut microbiota's role in NPD and its interactions with pharmacological treatments.",Molecular psychiatry
